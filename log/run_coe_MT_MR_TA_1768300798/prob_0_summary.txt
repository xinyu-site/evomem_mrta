[Error Cause Analysis]  
[Core Error]: The model incorrectly assumes that robots can travel directly to tasks without accounting for their movement sequence or intermediate positions.  

[Specific Analysis]: The objective sums distances from robots' initial positions to tasks, ignoring that robots may move between tasks over time steps, requiring dynamic distance calculations based on their current positions.  

[Potential Consequences]: The model will underestimate actual travel distances, leading to infeasible or suboptimal solutions where robots cannot physically reach tasks in the required time steps.
