In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 4 robots and 2 tasks. The robots' positions are [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0], and [3.0, 3.0], and the tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0] and [2.0, 3.0]. Each task must be assigned exactly 2 robots, and each robot must handle one task. The goal is to assign robots to tasks such that the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots is minimized. The minimal total distance for this configuration is 4.
