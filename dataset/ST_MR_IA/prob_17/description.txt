In the critical infrastructure of an electrical substation mapped onto a 2D Cartesian plane, the maintenance system directs a fleet of inspection vehicles (designated as Robots, indexed 0 to $N$) to service a set of high-voltage equipment clusters (designated as Tasks, indexed 0 to $M$). The allocation decision is computed instantaneously at time step 0. Distinct from standard single-unit checks, each equipment cluster is assigned a specific "Inspection Load," which dictates the exact integer number of vehicles required to perform the multi-angle analysis simultaneously. The operational rules mandate that every vehicle must be assigned to exactly one equipment cluster. Conversely, each cluster must receive a number of vehicles strictly equal to its assigned load. The objective is to formulate an assignment strategy that minimizes the total Euclidean distance covered by the fleet, ensuring that the aggregate deployment cost is optimized while satisfying the mandatory vehicle count for each equipment cluster.
