In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 4 robots and 2 tasks. The positions of the robots are [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0], and [3.0, 3.0], and the tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0] and [2.0, 3.0]. Each task requires 2 robots, and each robot can handle one task at a time. The goal is to assign tasks to robots such that the total Euclidean distance between the assigned robots and tasks is minimized. In this example, the total minimized Euclidean distance is 4.
