In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 4 robots and 2 tasks. The positions of the robots are [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0], and [3.0, 3.0]. The tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0] and [2.0, 3.0]. Each task requires exactly 2 robots, and each robot must be assigned to one task. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance from the robots to their assigned tasks. The optimal assignment minimizes the sum of Euclidean distances for robots assigned to each task. In this case, the optimal total distance is 4.
