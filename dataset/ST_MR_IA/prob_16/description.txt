In the context of an electrical substation inspection mapped on a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate plane, the system manages inspection vehicles and critical equipment clusters. The vehicles are labeled as Robots, and the equipment clusters are labeled as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1). The goal is to allocate vehicles to equipment clusters to minimize the total Euclidean distance. Each inspection vehicle must be assigned to exactly one equipment cluster. Crucially, each equipment cluster task specifies a required number of vehicles needed to perform the inspection (e.g., for multi-angle visual analysis). The assignment decisions are made instantaneously at time step 0. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for the vehicles assigned to their respective clusters while satisfying the vehicle count requirements for each task.
