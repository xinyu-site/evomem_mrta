In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are two entities: Robots and Tasks. The aim is to allocate robots to tasks in a way that minimizes the total Euclidean distance between the robots and the locations of the tasks. Every robot must be paired with exactly one task, while each task has a defined number of robots it requires. The goal is to minimize the overall sum of Euclidean distances for the robots assigned to each task, ensuring that the allocation satisfies all the task requirements.
