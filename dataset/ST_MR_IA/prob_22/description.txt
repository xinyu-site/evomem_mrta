During a large-scale public event mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate grid, security resources are divided into mobile security bots and designated crowd sectors. These are categorized as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1). The logistical goal is to distribute security bots to crowd sectors to minimize the total Euclidean distance. Each security bot must be assigned to exactly one crowd sector. To maintain safety standards, each crowd sector task dictates a specific number of security bots required to patrol that area. The allocation is determined instantaneously at time step 0. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for the security bots assigned to the crowd sectors, fulfilling the specific bot count requirements for every sector.
