In an urban environment mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, the operation involves a fleet of air quality monitoring drones and several pollution sensing zones. The drones are designated as Robots, and the sensing zones are designated as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1). The goal is to assign each drone to a sensing zone such that the total Euclidean distance from the drones to their assigned zones is minimized. Each drone must be assigned to exactly one sensing zone. However, depending on the size of the zone, each sensing zone requires a specific number of drones to operate effectively (e.g., a large zone might require 2 drones, while a small one requires 1). The assignment occurs instantaneously at time step 0. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for all drones assigned to the sensing zones, ensuring that every zone receives its required number of drones.
