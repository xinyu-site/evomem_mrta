In the context of a smart city traffic network modeled on a two-dimensional Cartesian grid, the system oversees a fleet of mobile surveillance units (designated as Robots, indexed starting from 0) and a set of complex traffic intersections (designated as Tasks, indexed starting from 0). The resource allocation decision is made instantaneously at time step 0. Unlike simple one-to-one pairings, each intersection is characterized by a specific "Monitoring Demand," representing the exact integer number of surveillance units required to monitor it effectively due to varying traffic complexities. The operational constraints require that every surveillance unit be assigned to exactly one intersection, ensuring full fleet utilization. Simultaneously, each intersection must receive a number of units strictly equal to its defined demand. The objective is to determine an assignment strategy that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the fleet, ensuring that the aggregate travel cost is optimized while satisfying the specific headcount requirements for all intersections.
