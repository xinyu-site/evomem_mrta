In a two-dimensional environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 4 robots and 2 tasks. The robots are positioned at [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0], and [3.0, 3.0]. The tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0] and [2.0, 3.0]. Each task requires exactly 2 robots, and each robot must be assigned to exactly one task. The task assignment should minimize the total Euclidean distance between the robots and their respective tasks. The minimal total distance is 4.
