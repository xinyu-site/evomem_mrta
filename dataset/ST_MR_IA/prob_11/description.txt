In an urban atmospheric monitoring operation mapped onto a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, the system manages a fleet of air quality monitoring drones, referred to as "Robots," and a set of designated pollution sensing zones, referred to as "Tasks." Adhering to a zero-based indexing convention, all entities are identified by unique integers starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Task 0). The operational snapshot occurs instantaneously at time step 0. Unlike standard one-to-one scenarios, each sensing zone is characterized by a specific "Service Demand," indicating the exact number of drones required to monitor it effectively based on its size or complexity. While each drone must be assigned to exactly one zone to ensure full utilization, a single zone may receive multiple drones to meet its demand quota. The objective is to compute an allocation strategy that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the entire fleet, ensuring that every drone is deployed and every sensing zone receives its exact required number of units.
