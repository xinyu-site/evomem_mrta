Within a smart city traffic network represented by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are distinct entities: mobile surveillance units and complex traffic intersections. These are referred to as Robots and Tasks, respectively. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1). The goal is to dispatch surveillance units to intersections such that the total Euclidean distance traveled is minimized. Each surveillance unit must be assigned to exactly one intersection. Due to varying traffic complexities, each intersection task defines a specific requirement for the number of surveillance units needed to monitor it simultaneously. The assignment is calculated instantaneously at time step 0. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for the surveillance units assigned to the intersections, strictly adhering to the unit count requirement for each intersection.
