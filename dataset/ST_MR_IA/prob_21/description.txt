The problem is defined within the spatial coordinates of a woodland ecology zone. We have a set of autonomous ground units, labeled as "Robots," and a collection of required sensing locations, labeled as "Tasks." Both entities adhere to a zero-based indexing convention. The challenge is to resolve a static resource dispatch problem at time step 0. Each sensing location imposes a strict "Unit Requirement," specifying the headcount of Robots needed to process that location effectively. Constraints require a complete mapping where every Robot is uniquely paired with a single Task, but a single Task serves as the destination for multiple Robots based on its requirement. The optimization goal is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for all assigned Robot-Task pairs, achieving the most efficient spatial distribution that meets the specific staffing needs of every sensing location.
