Operating within a forest reserve defined by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, the scenario involves ecological monitoring rovers and biological sampling sites. These are formally identified as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1). The goal is to position rovers at sampling sites such that the total Euclidean distance is minimized. Each rover must be assigned to exactly one sampling site. Each sampling site task has a specific requirement for the number of rovers needed to collect data simultaneously. The assignment occurs instantaneously at time step 0. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for the rovers assigned to the sampling sites, ensuring each site is covered by the exact number of required rovers.
