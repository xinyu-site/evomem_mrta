In a 2D environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 4 robots and 2 tasks. The robots' positions are [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0], and [3.0, 3.0], while the tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0] and [2.0, 3.0]. Each task requires exactly 2 robots, and each robot is assigned to exactly one task. The objective is to assign robots to tasks such that the total Euclidean distance is minimized. The optimal assignment results in a total minimized distance of 4.
