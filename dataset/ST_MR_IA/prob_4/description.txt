In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 4 robots and 2 tasks. The positions of the robots are as follows: Robot 1 at [0.0, 0.0], Robot 2 at [1.0, 1.0], Robot 3 at [2.0, 2.0], and Robot 4 at [3.0, 3.0]. The positions of the tasks are: Task 1 at [0.0, 1.0] and Task 2 at [2.0, 3.0]. Each task has a specific number of robots it requires, with Task 1 requiring 2 robots and Task 2 also requiring 2 robots. The objective is to assign robots to tasks in such a way that the total Euclidean distance between each robot and its assigned task is minimized. The minimal sum of Euclidean distances for the robot-task assignments is 4.
