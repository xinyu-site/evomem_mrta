The problem is defined within an urban traffic management zone represented by XY spatial coordinates. We have a group of autonomous monitoring agents, labeled as "Robots," and a series of target road junctions, labeled as "Tasks." Both groups follow a zero-based indexing convention. The challenge is to solve a static deployment problem at time step 0 where resource needs vary by location. Each target junction imposes a strict "Unit Count Requirement," specifying how many agents must be dispatched to that location simultaneously to capture adequate data. Constraints dictate that each Robot must be uniquely mapped to a single Task, whereas a single Task may be the destination for multiple Robots depending on its requirement. The optimization goal is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for all assigned Robot-Task pairs, finding the most efficient spatial distribution that meets the specific staffing needs of every junction.
