In a large-scale public event environment mapped onto a 2D Cartesian grid, the security command center manages a fleet of autonomous security bots (designated as Robots, indexed starting from 0) to secure a set of designated crowd sectors (designated as Tasks, indexed starting from 0). The resource allocation decision is executed instantaneously at time step 0. Distinct from standard one-to-one patrols, each crowd sector is characterized by a specific "Security Quota," which mandates the exact integer number of bots required to patrol that area effectively based on crowd density. The operational protocols require that every security bot must be assigned to exactly one crowd sector to ensure full fleet utilization. Conversely, each sector must receive a number of bots strictly equal to its assigned quota. The objective is to compute an allocation strategy that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the entire fleet, ensuring that the aggregate deployment cost is optimized while satisfying the mandatory bot count for each crowd sector.
