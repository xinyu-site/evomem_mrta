The problem is defined within the spatial coordinates of a major event venue. We have a set of mobile patrol units, labeled as "Robots," and a collection of critical security zones, labeled as "Tasks." Both entities adhere to a zero-based indexing convention. The challenge is to resolve a static resource dispatch problem at time step 0. Each security zone imposes a strict "Unit Requirement," specifying the headcount of Robots needed to secure that zone effectively. Constraints require a complete mapping where every Robot is uniquely paired with a single Task, but a single Task serves as the destination for multiple Robots based on its requirement. The optimization goal is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for all assigned Robot-Task pairs, achieving the most efficient spatial distribution that meets the specific staffing needs of every security zone.
