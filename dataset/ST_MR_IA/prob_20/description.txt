In the context of a protected forest reserve mapped onto a 2D Cartesian plane, the ecological management system directs a fleet of monitoring rovers (designated as Robots, indexed starting from 0) to service a set of biological sampling sites (designated as Tasks, indexed starting from 0). The resource allocation decision is computed instantaneously at time step 0. Unlike simple single-unit observations, each sampling site is characterized by a specific "Sampling Quota," which dictates the exact integer number of rovers required to gather data simultaneously for statistical validity. The operational rules mandate that every rover must be assigned to exactly one sampling site, ensuring no unit is left idle. Conversely, each sampling site must receive a number of rovers strictly equal to its assigned quota. The objective is to formulate an assignment strategy that minimizes the total Euclidean distance covered by the fleet, ensuring that the aggregate deployment cost is optimized while satisfying the mandatory rover count for each sampling site.
