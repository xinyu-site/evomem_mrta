The problem is situated within a city sector defined by XY spatial coordinates. We have a set of autonomous UAVs, labeled as "Robots," and a collection of environmental target areas, labeled as "Tasks." Both sets are indexed starting from 0. The goal is to solve a static resource allocation problem at time step 0. Each target area imposes a strict "Resource Requirement," specifying an integer count of UAVs needed to perform the sensing operation simultaneously. The constraint logic dictates that every Robot must be uniquely assigned to a single Task, but a Task can—and often must—be the destination for multiple Robots depending on its specified requirement. The optimization function seeks to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for all Robot-Task pairings, finding the most efficient distribution of the fleet that satisfies the specific headcount requirement for each target area.
