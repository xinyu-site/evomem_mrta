In a two-dimensional environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are two types of entities: Robots and Tasks. The goal is to assign robots to tasks such that the total Euclidean distance from robots to their assigned task locations is minimized. Each robot must be assigned to exactly one task, and each task must be assigned a specific number of robots as defined in the task requirements. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for robots assigned to each task.
