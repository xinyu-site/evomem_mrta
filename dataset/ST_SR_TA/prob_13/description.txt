Within a smart city traffic network represented by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 mobile surveillance units and 3 critical intersections. These entities are referred to as Robots and Tasks, respectively. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The system operates over 4 time steps, starting from time step 0. Each intersection requires a traffic analysis check to be performed exactly once by a surveillance unit. This check must occur at a specific time step within the intersection's designated time window (EarliestStep to LatestStep). Each surveillance unit can visit at most one intersection per time step. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the surveillance units while ensuring all intersections are analyzed within their valid timeframes.
