Operating within a forest reserve defined by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 ecological monitoring rovers and 3 biological observation points. These are formally identified as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The monitoring period lasts for 4 time steps, starting from time step 0. Each observation point needs to be sampled exactly once by a rover. The sampling must occur at a time step that lies within the observation point's specific time window (EarliestStep and LatestStep). Each rover can process at most one observation point per time step. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the rovers to satisfy all sampling requirements within the valid time windows.
