The scenario takes place within a woodland ecology zone represented by XY spatial coordinates. The system coordinates 3 autonomous ground vehicles, labeled as "Robots" (indices 0, 1, 2), to service a set of 3 required bio-sampling locations, labeled as "Tasks" (indices 0, 1, 2). The mission planning horizon consists of 4 time units, indexed from 0 to 3. Each sampling location dictates a strict temporal constraint, requiring a single visit at a time step $t$ that satisfies the condition $EarliestStep \le t \le LatestStep$. The allocation logic must ensure that every task is completed exactly once. Additionally, a physical constraint exists where each Robot can visit a maximum of one Task per time step. The objective is to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for all assigned Robot-Task pairs, optimizing the spatial deployment of the rovers to meet the time-sensitive biological monitoring needs.
