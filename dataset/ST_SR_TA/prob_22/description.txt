During a large-scale public event mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate grid, there are 3 security bots and 3 specific crowd sectors. These are categorized as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The security operation is planned over 4 time steps, starting from time step 0. Each crowd sector must be secured exactly once by a security bot. This security check must be executed at a single time step within the sector's assigned time window, defined by EarliestStep and LatestStep. Each security bot can secure at most one crowd sector per time step. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the security bots while ensuring all sectors are secured within their respective time constraints.
