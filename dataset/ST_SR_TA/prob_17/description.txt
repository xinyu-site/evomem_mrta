In the high-voltage environment of an electrical substation mapped onto a 2D Cartesian plane, the maintenance system directs a fleet of 3 mobile inspection vehicles (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) to verify the status of 3 critical equipment nodes (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The inspection mission is confined to a discrete timeline of 4 time steps, beginning at step 0. To ensure operational safety and efficiency, each equipment node is assigned a strict validity interval defined by an EarliestStep and a LatestStep. The core requirement is that every node must be inspected exactly once by a vehicle at a specific time step that falls within this allowable window. Furthermore, a single vehicle is capable of inspecting at most one node during any given time step. The objective is to formulate an assignment and execution schedule that minimizes the total Euclidean distance covered by the fleet, ensuring that all equipment checks are completed within their respective valid timeframes.
