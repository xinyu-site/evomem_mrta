In a two-dimensional environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 3 tasks. The robots are located at positions [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0], and [3.0, 1.0]. The tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0], [3.0, 3.0], and [4.0, 1.0]. These tasks need to be assigned to the robots over 4 discrete time steps. Each robot can handle only one task per time step, and each task requires exactly one robot at each time step. The tasks are assigned within their respective time windows, with EarliestStep and LatestStep defining the valid range for each task. Specifically, Task 0 has an EarliestStep of 0 and a LatestStep of 1, Task 1 has an EarliestStep of 1 and a LatestStep of 2, and Task 2 has an EarliestStep of 1 and a LatestStep of 3. 

The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots while completing their tasks. Each task must be assigned to exactly one robot per time step, and each robot can be assigned to at most one task at a time. The minimal total distance in this scenario is 3.0.
