The scenario is set within an urban traffic network defined by XY spatial coordinates. The system coordinates 3 autonomous monitoring agents (Robots 0, 1, 2) to cover 3 high-priority road junctions (Tasks 0, 1, 2). The mission timeline spans 4 time units starting from step 0. Each junction has a unique time window $[E_j, L_j]$ (EarliestStep to LatestStep), and the monitoring task for that junction must be executed at a single time step falling strictly within this interval. A constraint applies where each agent can process a maximum of one junction per time step. The optimization goal is to determine the precise pairing of agents to junctions and the specific execution times such that the aggregate Euclidean distance of all deployments is minimized, satisfying all temporal and coverage constraints.
