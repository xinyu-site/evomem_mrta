In a smart city infrastructure mapped onto a 2D Cartesian grid, the traffic control center manages 3 mobile surveillance units (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) and identifies 3 critical intersections requiring analysis (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The operation is planned over a horizon of 4 discrete time steps, commencing at $t=0$. Each intersection is subject to a strict temporal constraint, defined by an EarliestStep and a LatestStep, creating a specific validity window during which the analysis must take place. The operational mandate requires that every intersection be visited exactly once by a surveillance unit within its designated window. Furthermore, a single unit can attend to at most one intersection per time step. The system's objective is to solve for an assignment and schedule that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the fleet, ensuring all traffic analysis mandates are fulfilled on time.
