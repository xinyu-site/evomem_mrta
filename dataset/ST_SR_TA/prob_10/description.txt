In an urban environment mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 air quality monitoring drones and 3 pollution sensing locations. The drones are designated as Robots and the sensing locations as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The operation spans 4 discrete time steps, starting from time step 0. Each sensing location must be visited and monitored exactly once by a drone at a single time step that falls within its specific time window, defined by the EarliestStep and LatestStep for each location. Each drone can handle at most one sensing location per time step. The goal is to determine the assignment and schedule that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the drones to complete all monitoring tasks within their valid windows.
