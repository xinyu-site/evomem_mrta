In a protected forest reserve modeled on a two-dimensional Cartesian grid, the ecological management system controls a fleet of 3 monitoring rovers (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) to collect data from 3 biological observation points (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The monitoring campaign operates over a discrete timeline of 4 time steps, starting from step 0. Each observation point has a specific validity interval defined by an EarliestStep and a LatestStep, representing the time window during which the biological event is observable. The operational constraint requires that every observation point be sampled exactly once by a rover within its designated time window. Furthermore, due to processing limitations, a single rover can handle at most one observation point during any given time step. The system aims to compute an optimal schedule that assigns rovers to points and determines the sampling times, such that the total Euclidean distance traveled by the fleet is minimized while strictly adhering to all temporal and coverage requirements.
