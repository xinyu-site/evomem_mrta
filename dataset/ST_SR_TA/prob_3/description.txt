In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 3 tasks. The tasks need to be allocated to the robots over 4 discrete time steps. At each time step, each robot can be assigned to only one task, and each task must be assigned to one robot. Each task has a designated time window for assignment, specified by an EarliestStep and a LatestStep. These values define the range of valid time steps within which the task can be performed. If a task's EarliestStep exceeds its LatestStep, the time window should be adjusted to ensure that it is valid.

The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance that the robots travel while completing their tasks. Every task must be assigned to exactly one robot at each time step, and no robot can handle more than one task at the same time step.
