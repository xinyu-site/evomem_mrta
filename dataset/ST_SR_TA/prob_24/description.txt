The problem is situated within the spatial confines of a major event venue, represented by XY coordinates. The system coordinates a team of 3 mobile security units, labeled as "Robots" (indices 0, 1, 2), to monitor 3 designated high-density zones, labeled as "Tasks" (indices 0, 1, 2). The mission planning covers a duration of 4 time units, indexed from 0 to 3. Each zone requires a mandatory security check, which must take place at a single time step $t$ such that $EarliestStep \le t \le LatestStep$. The scheduling logic must guarantee that every task is completed exactly once. Additionally, a physical constraint exists where each Robot can attend to a maximum of one Task per time step. The goal is to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for all deployed units, optimizing the spatiotemporal allocation of resources to meet the event's security needs.
