This scenario involves the logistical coordination of resources within an electrical substation defined by XY spatial coordinates. The system manages 3 autonomous ground units (Robots 0, 1, 2) tasked with monitoring 3 specific infrastructure checkpoints (Tasks 0, 1, 2). The operation spans a duration of 4 time units, indexed from 0 to 3. Each checkpoint requires a single visit, which must occur within a pre-defined time window $[EarliestStep, LatestStep]$. The scheduling algorithm must ensure that every checkpoint is successfully visited exactly once within its valid period. Additionally, physical constraints dictate that a Robot can attend to a maximum of one Task per time step. The goal is to determine the optimal pairing of Robots to Tasks and the precise timing of these visits such that the sum of Euclidean distances for all assigned pairs is minimized.
