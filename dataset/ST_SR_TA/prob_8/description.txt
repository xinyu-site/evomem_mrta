In a two-dimensional XY coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 3 tasks. The robots' positions are [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0], and [3.0, 1.0], and the tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0], [3.0, 3.0], and [4.0, 1.0]. The tasks must be assigned over 4 time steps, with each task requiring exactly one robot per time step. Each task must be completed within a valid time window, defined by the EarliestStep and LatestStep. Task 0 has a time window from step 0 to step 1, Task 1 must be completed between time steps 1 and 2, and Task 2 can be completed between time steps 1 and 3.

The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots while completing their assigned tasks. Each robot can handle one task at a time per time step, and each task must be assigned to exactly one robot. The optimal total distance is 3.0.
