In a two-dimensional environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 3 tasks. The tasks must be assigned to robots over 4 time steps. Each robot can handle at most one task at a time per time step, and each task requires exactly one robot at each time step. Tasks are assigned within their respective time windows, defined by the EarliestStep and LatestStep for each task. The EarliestStep and LatestStep indicate the valid range of time steps during which each task can be assigned to a robot. If a task's EarliestStep is greater than its LatestStep, the task's time window should be adjusted accordingly.

The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots while completing their assigned tasks. Each task must be assigned to exactly one robot per time step, and each robot can be assigned to at most one task per time step.
