In a large-scale public event environment mapped onto a 2D Cartesian grid, the security apparatus employs 3 autonomous security bots (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) to secure 3 distinct crowd sectors (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The security operation is structured over a timeline of 4 discrete time steps, commencing at step 0. To maintain order efficiently, each crowd sector is assigned a specific validity interval defined by an EarliestStep and a LatestStep. The operational protocol dictates that every sector must be secured exactly once by a bot within its assigned time window. Furthermore, a single security bot is capable of managing at most one sector during any given time step. The system's objective is to devise an optimal assignment and schedule that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traversed by the bots, ensuring that all security checks are executed strictly within their required timeframes.
