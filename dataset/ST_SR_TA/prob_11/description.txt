In an urban district modeled on a 2D Cartesian plane, the air quality management system oversees a fleet of 3 aerial drones (designated as Robots, indexed 0 to 2) and 3 pollution hotspots (designated as Tasks, indexed 0 to 2). The operation is constrained to a finite horizon of 4 discrete time steps (indexed 0, 1, 2, 3). A critical operational requirement is that each hotspot must be analyzed exactly once. Furthermore, this analysis must occur within a specific validity interval defined by an EarliestStep and LatestStep for each target location. While a drone can only attend to one target at any given time step, the system must determine the optimal allocation of drones to targets and the precise timing of these visits. The overarching objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traversed by the fleet to fulfill all monitoring requirements within the valid time windows.
