Consider a pollution monitoring task within a city represented by XY spatial coordinates. The resources available include 3 autonomous quadcopters (Robots $0-2$) and a set of 3 required sampling points (Tasks $0-2$). The mission planning occurs over a timeline of 4 time units, starting from $t=0$. Every sampling point imposes a strict temporal constraint, requiring service at a single time step $t$ such that $EarliestStep \le t \le LatestStep$. The scheduling logic must ensure that every sampling point is successfully visited exactly once. Constraints dictate that a Robot can process at most one Task per time step. The solver must generate a joint assignment and schedule—pairing Robots to Tasks and assigning execution times—such that the sum of Euclidean distances for all assigned pairs is minimized.
