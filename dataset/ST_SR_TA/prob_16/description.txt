In the context of an electrical substation inspection mapped on a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate plane, there are 3 inspection vehicles and 3 equipment checkpoints. The vehicles are labeled as Robots and the checkpoints as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The inspection mission covers 4 time steps, starting from time step 0. Each equipment checkpoint must be inspected exactly once by a vehicle. This inspection must take place at a single time step chosen within the checkpoint's allowable time window, defined by EarliestStep and LatestStep. Each vehicle can inspect at most one checkpoint per time step. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the inspection vehicles while completing all assigned inspections within the required windows.
