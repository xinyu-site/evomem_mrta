The problem is defined within a city sector represented by XY spatial coordinates. We have 2 autonomous aerial units, labeled as "Robots," and 3 environmental targets, labeled as "Tasks." Both entities adhere to a zero-based indexing convention. The goal is to solve a static dispatch problem at time step 0. The assignment logic is flexible regarding drone capacity, allowing a single Robot to service multiple Tasks simultaneously (conceptually grouping them), but it is strict regarding Task coverage: every Task must be mapped to one and only one Robot. The optimization goal is to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for all defined pairings. This involves calculating the distance from each Task to all available Robots and assigning the Task to the Robot that minimizes the individual travel cost, thereby minimizing the global sum.
