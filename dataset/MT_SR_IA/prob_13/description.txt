Within a smart city traffic network represented by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 2 mobile surveillance units and 3 critical intersections. These entities are referred to as Robots and Tasks, respectively. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The assignment occurs instantaneously at time step 0. Each surveillance unit can be responsible for monitoring multiple intersections, but each intersection must be assigned to exactly one surveillance unit. The goal is to partition the intersections among the units such that the total Euclidean distance is minimized. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances between the units and their assigned intersections.
