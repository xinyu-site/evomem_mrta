In an urban environment mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 2 air quality monitoring drones and 3 pollution sensing zones. The drones are designated as Robots and the sensing zones as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The assignment is determined instantaneously at time step 0. While each drone is capable of being assigned to monitor multiple sensing zones (handling a cluster of tasks), each specific sensing zone must be assigned to exactly one drone. The goal is to determine the assignment that minimizes the total Euclidean distance from the drones to their assigned sensing zones. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances, ensuring every zone is covered by a drone.
