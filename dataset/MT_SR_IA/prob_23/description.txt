In a large-scale public event environment mapped onto a two-dimensional Cartesian grid, the security command center manages a fleet of 2 autonomous security bots (designated as Robots, indexed 0-1) to secure 3 distinct crowd sectors (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The resource allocation is computed instantaneously at time step 0. Unlike strictly paired assignments, this operation operates on a "One-to-Many" basis, where a single security bot may be responsible for a cluster of crowd sectors within its vicinity. However, strict operational protocols mandate that each distinct crowd sector must be assigned to exactly one security bot to ensure clear jurisdictional responsibility. The objective is to partition the set of crowd sectors into coverage zones assigned to each bot such that the total Euclidean distance from the bots to their assigned sectors is minimized. This optimization determines the most efficient static deployment, effectively assigning each sector to the nearest available bot.
