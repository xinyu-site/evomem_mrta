In an urban atmospheric monitoring operation mapped onto a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, the system manages a fleet of 2 air quality monitoring drones (designated as Robots, indexed 0-1) and a set of 3 pollution sensing zones (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The resource allocation is computed instantaneously at time step 0. Unlike strictly paired assignments, this scenario permits a "One-to-Many" capability, where a single drone may be responsible for a cluster of multiple sensing zones. However, the operational constraints mandate that each specific sensing zone must be assigned to exactly one drone to ensure clear accountability. The objective is to partition the set of sensing zones into clusters assigned to each drone such that the total Euclidean distance from the drones to their assigned zones is minimized. This optimization effectively determines the optimal "catchment area" for each drone based on the static positions.
