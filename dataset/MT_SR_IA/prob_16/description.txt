In the context of an electrical substation inspection mapped on a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate plane, there are 2 inspection vehicles and 3 equipment checkpoints. The vehicles are labeled as Robots and the checkpoints as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The assignment takes place instantaneously at time step 0. An inspection vehicle can be assigned to check multiple equipment checkpoints, but each checkpoint must be assigned to exactly one vehicle. The goal is to allocate the checkpoints to the vehicles so that the total Euclidean distance is minimized. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for the vehicles relative to their assigned checkpoints.
