In the critical infrastructure environment of an electrical substation mapped onto a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, the maintenance system directs a fleet of 2 inspection vehicles (designated as Robots, indexed 0-1) to service a set of 3 equipment checkpoints (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The resource allocation is calculated instantaneously at time step 0. Distinct from one-to-one mapping, this operational scenario allows for a "One-to-Many" assignment capability, meaning a single inspection vehicle can be responsible for verifying a cluster of equipment checkpoints. However, strict safety protocols mandate that each specific checkpoint must be assigned to exactly one vehicle to ensure accountability. The objective is to partition the set of checkpoints into coverage zones assigned to each vehicle such that the total Euclidean distance from the vehicles to their assigned checkpoints is minimized. This optimization effectively assigns each checkpoint to the nearest available vehicle.
