In a protected forest reserve modeled on a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, the ecological management system controls a fleet of 2 ecological monitoring rovers (designated as Robots, indexed 0-1) to service 3 biological sampling sites (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The resource allocation is computed instantaneously at time step 0. Unlike strictly paired assignments, this operation operates on a "One-to-Many" basis, where a single rover may be responsible for a cluster of sampling sites within its vicinity. However, strict operational protocols mandate that each distinct sampling site must be assigned to exactly one rover to ensure clear data accountability. The objective is to partition the set of sampling sites into coverage sectors assigned to each rover such that the total Euclidean distance from the rovers to their assigned sites is minimized. This optimization determines the most efficient static deployment, effectively assigning each site to the nearest available rover.
