In a two-dimensional XY coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 3 tasks. The positions of the robots are [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0], and [3.0, 1.0], and the positions of the tasks are [0.0, 1.0], [3.0, 3.0], and [4.0, 1.0]. These tasks need to be assigned over 4 time steps, with each task requiring exactly one robot per time step. The tasks must be completed within their valid time windows, which are defined by the EarliestStep and LatestStep for each task. For example, Task 0 can only be assigned during time steps 0 and 1, Task 1 must be assigned between time steps 1 and 2, and Task 2 is valid between time steps 1 and 3.

The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots. Each robot can only handle one task at a time, and each task must be assigned to exactly one robot at each time step. The minimal total distance in this example is 3.0.
