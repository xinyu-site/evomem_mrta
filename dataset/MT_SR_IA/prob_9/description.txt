In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 3 tasks. The robots are at positions [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0], and [3.0, 1.0], while the tasks are at [0.0, 1.0], [3.0, 3.0], and [4.0, 1.0]. The tasks must be assigned over a period of 4 discrete time steps, with each robot handling one task per time step. Each task must be assigned within its specific time window, defined by EarliestStep and LatestStep. Task 0 is assigned between time steps 0 and 1, Task 1 is assigned between time steps 1 and 2, and Task 2 is assigned between time steps 1 and 3.

The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots while completing their tasks. The task assignments are instantaneous, with each robot completing one task at each time step. The minimal total distance for the assignments in this case is 3.0.
