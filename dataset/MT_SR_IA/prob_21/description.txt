The problem is defined within a forest ecology zone represented by XY spatial coordinates. We have 2 autonomous ground units, labeled as "Robots," and 3 required bio-data targets, labeled as "Tasks." Both entities adhere to a zero-based indexing convention. The goal is to solve a static dispatch problem at time step 0. The assignment logic allows for flexible resource utilization, permitting a single Robot to service multiple Tasks simultaneously (grouping them by proximity), while strictly enforcing that every Task is mapped to one and only one Robot. The optimization goal is to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for all defined pairings. This process involves calculating the distance from each Task to all available Robots and assigning the Task to the Robot that minimizes the individual travel cost, thereby minimizing the global sum of distances for the entire monitoring network.
