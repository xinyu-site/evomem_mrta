In a two-dimensional environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, we have 3 robots and 3 tasks. The robots' positions are [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0], and [3.0, 1.0], and the tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0], [3.0, 3.0], and [4.0, 1.0]. The tasks are to be assigned within 4 time steps, with each robot handling only one task at a time. Each task needs to be assigned to one robot per time step, and the tasks must be completed within their respective time windows, defined by the EarliestStep and LatestStep. For example, Task 0 can be assigned at time steps 0 or 1, Task 1 must be assigned between time steps 1 and 2, and Task 2 can be assigned between time steps 1 and 3.

The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance that the robots travel while completing their tasks. Each robot can handle one task per time step, and each task must be assigned to exactly one robot. The total minimized distance in this scenario is 3.0.
