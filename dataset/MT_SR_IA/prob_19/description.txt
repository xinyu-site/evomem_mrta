Operating within a forest reserve defined by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 2 ecological monitoring rovers and 3 biological sampling sites. These are formally identified as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The assignment is calculated instantaneously at time step 0. Each rover can be assigned to manage multiple sampling sites, but each sampling site must be assigned to exactly one rover. The goal is to distribute the sites among the rovers to minimize the total Euclidean distance. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances from the rovers to their assigned sampling sites.
