In a smart city traffic network mapped onto a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, the system manages a fleet of 2 mobile surveillance units (designated as Robots, indexed 0-1) and a set of 3 critical intersections (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The resource allocation is computed instantaneously at time step 0. Unlike strictly paired assignments, this scenario operates on a "One-to-Many" basis, where a single surveillance unit may effectively monitor a cluster of intersections within its vicinity. However, strict operational protocols mandate that each distinct intersection must be assigned to exactly one surveillance unit to ensure clear jurisdictional responsibility. The objective is to partition the set of intersections into coverage sectors assigned to each unit such that the total Euclidean distance from the units to their assigned intersections is minimized. This optimization determines the most efficient static deployment, assigning each intersection to the nearest available unit.
