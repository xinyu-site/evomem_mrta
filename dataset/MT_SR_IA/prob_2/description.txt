In a two-dimensional environment, there are two robots and three tasks. Each robot can perform multiple tasks, but each task can only be assigned to one robot. The goal is to assign tasks to robots such that the total Euclidean distance is minimized. Each task must be assigned to exactly one robot, and each robot can perform multiple tasks. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances between robots and their assigned tasks. Robot numbers starting from 0.
