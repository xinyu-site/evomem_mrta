During a large-scale public event mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate grid, there are 2 security bots and 3 crowd sectors. These are categorized as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The assignment occurs instantaneously at time step 0. Each security bot can be assigned to secure multiple crowd sectors, but each crowd sector must be assigned to exactly one security bot. The goal is to group the sectors under the bots such that the total Euclidean distance is minimized. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances between the security bots and their assigned crowd sectors.
