In a two-dimensional XY coordinate system, 3 robots and 3 tasks are placed in a way that requires optimal pairing. The robots' locations are [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0], and [3.0, 1.0], while the tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0], [3.0, 3.0], and [4.0, 1.0]. The goal is to pair each robot with a task such that the total Euclidean distance between the robot-task pairs is minimized. Each robot must be assigned to a task, and each task must be assigned to a robot. The result of the optimal assignment is a total minimized distance of 3.0.
