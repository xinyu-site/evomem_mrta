In the context of a high-voltage electrical substation mapped onto a 2D Cartesian plane, the operation involves a fleet of autonomous ground vehicles, identified as "Robots," and a series of critical equipment nodes requiring status checks, identified as "Tasks." Both the vehicles and the equipment nodes are indexed starting from integer 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Task 0). The primary objective is to execute a precise one-to-one allocation strategy where every Robot is assigned to exactly one Task. The system aims to minimize the aggregate deployment cost, defined as the sum of the Euclidean distances between the current positions of the Robots and their target Tasks. This optimization is calculated instantaneously at time step 0, ensuring that the total distance traveled by the fleet to reach their inspection points is at its theoretical minimum.
