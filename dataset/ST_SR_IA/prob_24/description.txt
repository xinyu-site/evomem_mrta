This scenario operates on a two-dimensional grid representing a large-scale event venue. The system coordinates a fleet of mobile monitoring units, referred to as "Robots," to cover specific high-risk zones, referred to as "Tasks." All entities are indexed starting from integer 0. The core challenge is to solve an instantaneous assignment problem that pairs each Robot with exactly one Task. The optimization goal is to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance across the entire fleet, ensuring that the sum of the straight-line distances from each unit to its destination is at the lowest possible value. The solution dictates the static deployment of resources at the start of the operation (time step 0).
