In a two-dimensional environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are two types of entities: Robots and Tasks. The goal is to pair each Robot with a Task such that the total Euclidean distance between all pairs is minimized. Each Robot must be paired with one Task, and each Task must be paired with one Robot. Assignments are instantaneous, with no future planning considered. The code only needs to return the minimum total distance.
