This scenario takes place within the spatial confines of an electrical substation, represented mathematically by an XY coordinate system. The system controls a group of mobile inspection units, labeled as "Robots," and designates specific infrastructure checkpoints as "Tasks." Adhering to a zero-based indexing convention, the entities are distinguished by unique IDs starting from 0. The operational challenge is to pair each Robot with a unique Task such that the total Euclidean distance required for the fleet to cover all assignments is minimized. This requires a bijective mapping between the set of Robots and the set of Tasks. The allocation decision is made based on the static positions at time step 0, optimizing for the shortest cumulative straight-line path across all vehicle-checkpoint pairs without considering dynamic path planning.
