The problem is situated within a forest ecology management zone represented by XY spatial coordinates. We have a group of mobile sensing devices, referred to as "Robots," and a specific collection of ecological observation targets, referred to as "Tasks." Both the devices and the targets are indexed using integers starting from 0. The objective is to determine an optimal assignment strategy where every Robot is uniquely paired with exactly one Task. The system must minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for the entire group, meaning the sum of the straight-line distances for all assigned pairs must be at the lowest possible value. This calculation is performed for the immediate configuration at time step 0, focusing solely on the initial allocation cost.
