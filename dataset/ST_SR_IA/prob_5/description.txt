In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 3 tasks. The positions of the robots are as follows: Robot 0 is at [1.0, 1.0], Robot 1 is at [2.0, 3.0], and Robot 2 is at [3.0, 1.0]. The positions of the tasks are: Task 0 is at [0.0, 1.0], Task 1 is at [3.0, 3.0], and Task 2 is at [4.0, 1.0]. The goal is to pair each robot with a task such that the total Euclidean distance between all pairs is minimized. Each robot must be assigned to one task, and each task must be assigned to one robot. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance between the assigned robots and tasks. The total minimized distance in this example is 3.0.
