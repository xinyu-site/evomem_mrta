In the context of an electrical substation inspection mapped on a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate plane, the system manages mobile inspection vehicles and specific equipment checkpoints. The inspection vehicles are labeled as Robots, and the equipment checkpoints are labeled as Tasks. Both groups are indexed starting from 0, resulting in identifiers like Robot 0 and Task 0. The operational goal is to dispatch each inspection vehicle to a checkpoint so that the total Euclidean distance covered by the fleet is minimized. Each Robot must be paired with exactly one Task, and each Task must be paired with exactly one Robot. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances between the assigned Robots and Tasks, with the assignment decisions made instantaneously at time step 0.
