In this scenario, a protected forest reserve is digitally mapped onto a two-dimensional Cartesian plane. The operation utilizes a fleet of autonomous environmental monitoring units, designated as "Robots," to survey a set of critical biological interest points, designated as "Tasks." Adhering to a zero-based indexing protocol, each entity is assigned a unique identifier starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Task 0). The operational directive is to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the Robots and the Tasks. The primary optimization goal is to minimize the total deployment effort, quantified as the sum of the Euclidean distances between each Robot and its assigned Task. This allocation is computed instantaneously based on the static coordinates at time step 0, ensuring the most efficient spatial distribution of the monitoring fleet without accounting for subsequent path planning.
