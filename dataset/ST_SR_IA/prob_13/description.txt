Within a smart city traffic network represented by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are two distinct entities: traffic surveillance units and key intersections requiring analysis. These entities are referred to as Robots and Tasks, respectively. Following a 0-based indexing convention, the entities are identified as Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, and Task 1. The goal is to deploy each surveillance unit to a target intersection such that the aggregate Euclidean distance across all pairs is minimized. The assignment requires a one-to-one mapping where each Robot is assigned to exactly one Task, and each Task is assigned exactly one Robot. The optimization objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances between the paired Robots and Tasks, assuming immediate deployment at time step 0 with no future planning.
