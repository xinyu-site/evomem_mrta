Consider a sensor network deployment task within an urban grid represented by 2D spatial coordinates $(x, y)$. The system comprises a fleet of quadcopters, designated as "Robots," and a series of required air quality sampling points, designated as "Tasks." To facilitate digital processing, all entities are identified using integer indices starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot $N$; Task 0, Task $N$). The core challenge is to solve an instantaneous assignment problem where each Robot is uniquely paired with a single Task to perform air quality monitoring. The assignment logic must strictly adhere to a bijective mapping constraint, ensuring no Robot is left idle and no Task is left uncovered. The objective function for this allocation is to minimize the total deployment cost, which is defined as the sum of the Euclidean distances between the coordinates of the Robots and their assigned Tasks. The system seeks the optimal configuration that results in the shortest cumulative flight path for the initial deployment phase.
