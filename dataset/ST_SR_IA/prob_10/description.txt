In an urban environment mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, the operation involves a fleet of air quality monitoring drones and a set of critical pollution sensing locations. The drones are designated as Robots, and the sensing locations are designated as Tasks. Both the drones and the locations are indexed starting from 0, such as Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, and Task 1. The objective is to assign each drone to a specific sensing location to ensure that the total Euclidean distance required for deployment is minimized. There is a strict constraint that each Robot must be paired with exactly one Task, and each Task must be covered by exactly one Robot. The system aims to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances between the assigned Robots and Tasks, with the allocation being calculated instantaneously at time step 0 without considering subsequent flight paths.
