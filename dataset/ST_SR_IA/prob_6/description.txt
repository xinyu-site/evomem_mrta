Consider a 2D Cartesian coordinate plane where three robots and three tasks are situated. The task is to assign each robot to exactly one task while minimizing the total Euclidean distance between the robot-task pairs. In this setup, each task is assigned to one robot, and each robot must be matched with exactly one task. The robots are located at positions [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0], and [3.0, 1.0], and the tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0], [3.0, 3.0], and [4.0, 1.0]. The goal is to find the optimal robot-task assignments that result in the minimum possible distance. The total minimized travel distance in this case is 3.0.
