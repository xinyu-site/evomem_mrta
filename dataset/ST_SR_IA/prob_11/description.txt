In this scenario, a metropolitan area is modeled as a two-dimensional Cartesian plane defined by $X$ and $Y$ axes. The operation involves a specialized squadron of autonomous drones, referred to as "Agents," which are tasked with gathering data from specific atmospheric pollution hotspots, referred to as "Targets." Both the Agents and the Targets follow a strict zero-based indexing convention, meaning the first drone is labeled Agent 0 and the first hotspot is labeled Target 0. The primary operational goal is to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of Agents and the set of Targets. This means every Agent must be assigned to exactly one unique Target, and conversely, every Target must be serviced by exactly one Agent. The allocation strategy is governed by an optimization criterion: the system must minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for the entire fleet. This calculation is performed instantaneously for the current static positions at step 0, ensuring that the sum of the straight-line distances between each paired Agent and Target is at its lowest possible value.
