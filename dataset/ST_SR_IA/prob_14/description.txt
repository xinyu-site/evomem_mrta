In this operational scenario, a smart city's traffic network is modeled as a 2D Cartesian plane. The system manages a fleet of mobile surveillance units, designated as "Robots," which must be deployed to specific high-priority intersections, designated as "Tasks," to analyze traffic patterns. To align with digital processing standards, all entities follow a zero-based indexing system (e.g., Robot 0, Task 0). The primary objective is to execute an optimal assignment where each Robot is paired with exactly one Task. The optimization criterion is strictly defined to minimize the total deployment cost, calculated as the sum of the Euclidean distances between the current coordinates of the Robots and their assigned Intersections. This instantaneous allocation at time step 0 ensures the most efficient coverage of critical traffic nodes without factoring in subsequent movement trajectories.
