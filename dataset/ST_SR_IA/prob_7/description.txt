In a 2D environment with a standard XY Cartesian grid, there are 3 robots and 3 tasks. The robots are positioned at [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0], and [3.0, 1.0], while the tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0], [3.0, 3.0], and [4.0, 1.0]. The goal is to pair each robot with a task in such a way that the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots is minimized. Each robot should be assigned one task, and the tasks should be assigned without exceeding the required number of robots. The optimal pairing yields a total minimized distance of 3.0.
