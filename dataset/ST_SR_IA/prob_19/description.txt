Operating within a forest reserve defined by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, the scenario involves ecological monitoring devices and specific biological observation points. These are formally identified as Robots and Tasks. Indexing for all entities starts at 0, for example, Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, and Task 1. The challenge is to link each monitoring device to an observation point in a way that minimizes the total Euclidean distance of the fleet. A one-to-one correspondence is required, meaning each Robot visits exactly one Task and each Task is visited by exactly one Robot. The aim is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for the chosen pairs, with the optimal pairing determined instantaneously at time step 0.
