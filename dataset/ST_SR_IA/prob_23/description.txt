In the context of a high-density public gathering managed within a 2D Cartesian spatial framework, the operation involves a team of autonomous security bots, labeled as "Robots," and a set of designated crowd management sectors, labeled as "Tasks." Both the bots and the sectors are identified using a zero-based indexing system (e.g., Robot 0, Task 0). The logistical objective is to achieve an optimal one-to-one assignment where each Robot is dispatched to a unique Task. The system is designed to minimize the total deployment cost, which is quantified as the sum of the Euclidean distances between the Robots' initial positions and their assigned sectors. This allocation is computed instantaneously at time step 0, ensuring the most efficient coverage of the event space without considering future patrol routes.
