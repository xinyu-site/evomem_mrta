During a large-scale public event mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate grid, security resources are divided into mobile security bots and designated crowd sectors. These are categorized as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0, such as Robot 0 and Task 0. The logistical goal is to allocate each security bot to a specific crowd sector to ensure the total Euclidean distance between them is minimized. The allocation must be one-to-one, ensuring every Robot has a Task and every Task has a Robot. The system aims to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances between the paired Robots and Tasks, with the assignment decision being made instantaneously at time step 0 without regarding future movement.
