The problem is set within a two-dimensional geometric representation of an urban traffic grid, defined by X and Y coordinates. We have a set of autonomous monitoring agents, labeled as "Robots," and a corresponding set of critical traffic junctions requiring observation, labeled as "Tasks." Both sets adhere to a strict 0-based indexing convention. The challenge is to determine a one-to-one mapping between the Robots and the Tasks. The goal of this allocation is to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for the entire fleet, ensuring that the cumulative straight-line distance from each Robot to its designated junction is as small as possible. This optimization solves for the most efficient static distribution of resources at the initial moment, ensuring every junction is monitored by a unique agent with minimal total positional offset.
