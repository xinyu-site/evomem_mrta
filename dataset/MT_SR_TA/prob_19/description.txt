Operating within a forest reserve defined by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 2 ecological monitoring rovers and 3 biological sampling sites. These are formally identified as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The monitoring period is limited to 4 time steps, indexed from 0 to 3. A rover can travel to and sample multiple sites over the duration of the period, but each sampling site must be processed by exactly one rover at a designated time step. All sampling tasks must be executed within the 4 time steps. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the rovers to fulfill all sampling requirements.
