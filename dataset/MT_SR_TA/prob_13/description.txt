Within a smart city traffic network represented by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 2 mobile surveillance units and 3 critical intersections. These entities are referred to as Robots and Tasks, respectively. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The surveillance mission is constrained to 4 time steps, indexed from 0. Each surveillance unit can move to analyze multiple intersections over the course of the mission, but each intersection requires analysis by exactly one surveillance unit at a single time step. The entire set of intersections must be analyzed within the available 4 time steps. The objective is to assign the sequence of visits to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the surveillance units while ensuring every intersection is covered.
