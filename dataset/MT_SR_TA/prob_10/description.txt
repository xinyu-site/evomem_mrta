In an urban environment mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 2 air quality monitoring drones and 3 pollution sensing zones. The drones are designated as Robots and the sensing zones as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The operation spans 4 time steps, indexed from 0 to 3. While each drone is capable of monitoring multiple sensing zones sequentially across different time steps, each specific sensing zone must be visited and processed by exactly one drone at a specific time step. All monitoring tasks must be completed within the 4-step timeframe. The goal is to schedule the visits such that the total Euclidean distance traveled by the two drones to complete all assigned monitoring tasks is minimized.
