In a two-dimensional environment, there are 2 robots and 3 tasks. Each robot can handle multiple tasks, but every task must be assigned to exactly one robot. Tasks are completed in a single time step, and all tasks must be finished within a total of four time steps. The objective is to allocate tasks to robots in such a way that the total Euclidean distance is minimized. Each task must be assigned to one robot at a specific time step. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots to complete their tasks, with robot numbering starting from 0.
