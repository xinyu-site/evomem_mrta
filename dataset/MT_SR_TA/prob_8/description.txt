In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, 2 robots and 3 tasks are placed. The robots' positions are [0.0, 0.0] and [2.0, 0.0], and the tasks are at [0.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], and [2.0, 2.0]. These tasks need to be assigned to the robots within 4 discrete time steps. Each robot can only handle one task at a time, while each task must be assigned to one robot at a specific time step.

The tasks must be assigned to robots within their valid time windows. Task 0 is assigned between time step 0 and 1, Task 1 between time step 1 and 2, and Task 2 between time step 2 and 3. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots. In this scenario, the total minimized travel distance is 3.0.
