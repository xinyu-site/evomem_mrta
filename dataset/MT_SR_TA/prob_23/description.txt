In a large-scale public event environment mapped onto a 2D Cartesian grid, the security command center manages 2 autonomous security bots (designated as Robots, indexed 0-1) to secure 3 distinct crowd sectors (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The operation is confined to a discrete timeline of 4 time steps (indexed 0 to 3). Unlike instantaneous assignment models, this operation involves dynamic routing: a single security bot is capable of visiting and securing multiple crowd sectors sequentially across different time steps. The operational protocol mandates that every crowd sector must be secured exactly once by exactly one bot within the available timeframe. The system must determine the optimal visitation sequence for each bot. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the fleet as they transition between sectors (or from their starting positions) to complete the full set of security tasks.
