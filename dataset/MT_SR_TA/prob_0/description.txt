In a two-dimensional environment, there are two robots and three tasks. Each robot can perform multiple tasks, but each task must be assigned to exactly one robot. Each task is completed in a single time step, and all tasks must be completed within four time steps. The goal is to assign tasks to robots such that the total Euclidean distance is minimized. Each task must be assigned to exactly one robot at a specific time step. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots while completing their assigned tasks, with robot numbers starting from 0.
