In a protected forest reserve modeled on a 2D Cartesian grid, the ecological management system controls 2 autonomous monitoring rovers (designated as Robots, indexed 0-1) to process 3 biological sampling sites (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The operation is confined to a discrete timeline of 4 time steps (indexed 0 to 3). Unlike instantaneous assignment models, this operation involves dynamic routing: a single rover is capable of visiting and processing multiple sampling sites sequentially across different time steps. The operational protocol mandates that every sampling site must be visited exactly once by exactly one rover within the available timeframe. The system must determine the optimal visitation sequence for each rover. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the fleet as they transition between sampling sites (or from their starting positions) to complete the full set of monitoring tasks.
