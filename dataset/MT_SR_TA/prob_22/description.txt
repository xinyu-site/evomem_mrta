During a large-scale public event mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate grid, there are 2 security bots and 3 crowd sectors. These are categorized as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The security operation runs for 4 time steps, starting from index 0. Each security bot can be deployed to secure multiple crowd sectors in sequence, but each sector must be secured by exactly one security bot at a specific time step. All sectors must be attended to within the 4-step operational window. The goal is to plan the deployment to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the security bots while ensuring all crowd sectors are secured.
