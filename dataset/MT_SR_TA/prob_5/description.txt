In a two-dimensional environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 2 robots and 3 tasks. The positions of the robots are [0.0, 0.0] and [2.0, 0.0], while the tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], and [2.0, 2.0]. These tasks must be assigned to robots over 4 discrete time steps. Each task must be assigned to one robot at a specific time step, and each robot can handle one task at a time. The tasks must be completed within their respective time windows, defined by the EarliestStep and LatestStep for each task. For this example, Task 0 has an EarliestStep of 0 and a LatestStep of 1, Task 1 has an EarliestStep of 1 and a LatestStep of 2, and Task 2 has an EarliestStep of 2 and a LatestStep of 3.

The goal is to assign tasks to robots such that the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots is minimized. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by the robots while completing their assigned tasks, ensuring that each task is completed within its valid time window. The optimal assignment results in a minimal total distance of 3.0.
