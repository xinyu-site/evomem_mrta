In a 2D XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 2 robots and 3 tasks. The robots are located at [0.0, 0.0] and [2.0, 0.0], while the tasks are placed at [0.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], and [2.0, 2.0]. The tasks must be assigned to robots within 4 time steps. Each task must be assigned to exactly one robot, and each robot can handle only one task at a time. Tasks have specific time windows defined by EarliestStep and LatestStep.

Task 0 can be completed between time steps 0 and 1, Task 1 between time steps 1 and 2, and Task 2 between time steps 2 and 3. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots while completing their tasks, with the optimal total distance being 3.0.
