In the context of an electrical substation inspection mapped on a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate plane, there are 2 inspection vehicles and 3 equipment checkpoints. The vehicles are labeled as Robots and the checkpoints as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The inspection schedule allows for 4 time steps, starting from index 0. An inspection vehicle can be assigned to visit multiple checkpoints sequentially, but each checkpoint must be inspected by exactly one vehicle at a specific time step. All inspections must be finalized within the 4-step window. The goal is to determine the optimal schedule that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the inspection vehicles while completing all checkpoint tasks.
