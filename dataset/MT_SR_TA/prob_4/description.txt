In a two-dimensional environment, there are 2 robots and 3 tasks. The positions of the robots are as follows: Robot 0 at [0.0, 0.0] and Robot 1 at [2.0, 0.0]. The positions of the tasks are: Task 0 at [0.0, 1.0], Task 1 at [2.0, 1.0], and Task 2 at [2.0, 2.0]. Each task must be assigned to exactly one robot, and each robot can perform multiple tasks. The tasks must be completed in a single time step, with each task assigned to a robot at a specific time step. The tasks must be completed within a total of four time steps, and each task has its own valid time window for assignment. The EarliestStep for each task are as follows: Task 0 has an EarliestStep of 0, Task 1 has an EarliestStep of 1, and Task 2 has an EarliestStep of 2. The LatestStep for each task are as follows: Task 0 has a LatestStep of 1, Task 1 has a LatestStep of 2, and Task 2 has a LatestStep of 3.

The objective is to assign tasks to robots such that the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots is minimized. The goal is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances between the robots and their assigned tasks, with robot numbers starting from 0. The minimal total distance traveled by the robots in this example is 3.0.
