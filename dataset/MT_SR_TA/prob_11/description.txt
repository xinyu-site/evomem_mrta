In an urban atmospheric analysis scenario mapped onto a 2D Cartesian plane, the operation utilizes 2 autonomous drones (designated as Robots, indexed 0-1) to monitor 3 pollution sensing zones (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The mission is constrained within a discrete timeline of 4 time steps (indexed 0 to 3). Unlike instantaneous assignment models, this operation requires a sequential approach: a single drone is capable of visiting and processing multiple sensing zones one after another across different time steps. The operational rules mandate that each sensing zone must be visited exactly once by exactly one drone at a specific time step to ensure data uniqueness. The system must generate a valid schedule where all monitoring tasks are completed within the 4-step limit. The optimization objective is to determine the routing and scheduling sequence that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the two drones as they move between their assigned zones.
