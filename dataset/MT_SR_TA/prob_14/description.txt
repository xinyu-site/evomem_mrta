In a smart city traffic network mapped onto a 2D Cartesian grid, the surveillance system directs 2 mobile surveillance units (designated as Robots, indexed 0-1) to analyze 3 critical intersections (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The operation is confined to a discrete timeline of 4 time steps (indexed 0 to 3). Unlike static assignment scenarios, this operation involves dynamic routing: a single surveillance unit is capable of visiting and analyzing multiple intersections sequentially across different time steps. The operational protocol mandates that every critical intersection must be visited exactly once by exactly one unit within the available timeframe. The system must determine the optimal visitation sequence for each unit. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the fleet as they transition between intersections (or from their starting positions) to complete the full set of monitoring tasks.
