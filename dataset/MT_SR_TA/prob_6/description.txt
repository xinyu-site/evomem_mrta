In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 2 robots and 3 tasks. The robots are at positions [0.0, 0.0] and [2.0, 0.0], and the tasks are located at [0.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], and [2.0, 2.0]. The tasks must be completed within 4 time steps, with each task assigned to one robot at a specific time step. Each robot can perform one task at a time, and each task must be performed by exactly one robot.

The tasks are assigned within their respective time windows, with EarliestStep and LatestStep defining the valid range. Task 0 can be assigned from time step 0 to 1, Task 1 can be assigned from time step 1 to 2, and Task 2 can be assigned from time step 2 to 3. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots. The minimal total distance for this configuration is 3.0.
