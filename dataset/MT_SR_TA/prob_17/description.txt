In the critical infrastructure of an electrical substation mapped onto a 2D Cartesian plane, the maintenance system directs 2 mobile inspection vehicles (designated as Robots, indexed 0-1) to verify the status of 3 equipment checkpoints (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The operation is confined to a discrete timeline of 4 time steps (indexed 0 to 3). Unlike instantaneous assignment models, this operation involves dynamic routing: a single inspection vehicle is capable of visiting and processing multiple checkpoints sequentially across different time steps. The operational protocol mandates that every equipment checkpoint must be inspected exactly once by exactly one vehicle within the available timeframe. The system must determine the optimal visitation sequence for each vehicle. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the fleet as they transition between checkpoints (or from their starting positions) to complete the full set of inspection tasks.
