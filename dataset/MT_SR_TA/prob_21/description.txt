The problem is defined within a forest ecology zone represented by XY spatial coordinates. We have a fleet of 2 mobile sensor units, labeled as "Robots," and a set of 3 required bio-data targets, labeled as "Tasks." Both entities follow a zero-based indexing convention. The mission planning horizon consists of 4 temporal units, allowing for sequential task execution. In this model, the Robots function as mobile agents that traverse the grid to process a queue of Tasks over time. The constraints require that every Task be successfully processed exactly once within the 4-step limit. A Robot can attend to at most one Task per time step, and the order in which Tasks are assigned defines the travel path. The goal is to solve for a spatiotemporal schedule that minimizes the cumulative Euclidean distance of the paths for both Robots, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all targets.
