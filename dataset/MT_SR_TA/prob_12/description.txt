The problem is situated within a city sector defined by XY spatial coordinates. We have a fleet of 2 aerial monitoring units, labeled as "Robots," and a set of 3 required sampling targets, labeled as "Tasks." Both entities follow a zero-based indexing convention. The planning horizon consists of 4 temporal units, allowing for dynamic task execution. In this scenario, the Robots function as mobile agents that can execute a sequence of Tasks over time. The constraints require that every Task be successfully processed exactly once within the available timeframe. A Robot can attend to at most one Task per time step, and the sequence of Tasks assigned to a Robot determines its flight path. The goal is to solve for a spatiotemporal schedule that minimizes the cumulative Euclidean distance of the flight paths for both Robots, ensuring all targets are covered efficiently.
