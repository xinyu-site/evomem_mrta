In a two-dimensional environment, there are three robots and three tasks. Each task may require multiple robots, and each robot can perform multiple tasks. The assignment occurs instantaneously, with no future planning. Task 0 requires 2 robots, while Tasks 1 and 2 each require 1 robot. The goal is to assign robots to tasks such that the total Euclidean distance is minimized. Each task must be assigned a specific number of robots, as defined in the task requirements. Robots can be assigned to multiple tasks simultaneously, and there is no restriction on the number of tasks a robot can handle at the same time. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for robots assigned to each task.
