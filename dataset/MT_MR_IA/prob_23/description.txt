In a large-scale public event environment mapped onto a two-dimensional Cartesian grid, the security command center manages a fleet of 3 autonomous security bots (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) to secure 3 distinct crowd sectors (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The resource allocation is computed instantaneously at time step 0. A key operational feature is the bots' multi-sector oversight capability, enabled by high-bandwidth links, which allows a single bot to monitor multiple sectors simultaneously without capacity restrictions. Conversely, the crowd sectors impose specific safety demands: Task 0, a high-density VIP area, mandates the simultaneous presence of 2 security bots, whereas Task 1 and Task 2 are standard sectors requiring 1 bot each. The objective is to determine an assignment strategy that satisfies the specific bot count requirements for every sector while minimizing the total Euclidean distance of all established links between bots and sectors. Because bots have unlimited capacity, the allocation for each sector can be optimized independently.
