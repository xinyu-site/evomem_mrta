The problem is defined within the spatial confines of a major event venue represented by XY coordinates. We have 3 mobile security units, labeled as "Robots," and 3 critical security zones, labeled as "Tasks." Both entities adhere to a zero-based indexing convention. The goal is to solve a static dispatch problem at time step 0. The constraints are defined strictly by demand: Task 0 necessitates a coalition of 2 units for VIP protection, while Tasks 1 and 2 require 1 unit each. On the supply side, the Robots function as "Multi-Task" entities, capable of servicing any number of zones concurrently. Consequently, resource contention is eliminated, and the allocation for each Task simplifies to finding the nearest available neighbors regardless of their other commitments. The optimization goal is to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for all assigned pairings, ensuring that every security zone receives its exact required number of monitoring units.
