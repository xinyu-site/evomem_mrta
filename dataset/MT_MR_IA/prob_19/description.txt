Operating within a forest reserve defined by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 ecological monitoring rovers and 3 biological sampling sites. These are formally identified as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The assignment is determined instantaneously at time step 0. Task 0 is a dense biodiversity hotspot that demands 2 rovers for adequate coverage, while Task 1 and Task 2 require 1 rover each. The rovers are designed with multi-tasking capabilities, allowing a single rover to be assigned to multiple sampling sites simultaneously. The goal is to distribute the rovers to the sites to satisfy the specific rover requirements for each task. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled (or projected) for these assignments.
