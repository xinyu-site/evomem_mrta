In the critical infrastructure environment of an electrical substation mapped onto a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, the maintenance system directs a fleet of 3 inspection vehicles (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) to service 3 equipment checkpoints (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The resource allocation is calculated instantaneously at time step 0. A crucial operational feature is the vehicles' capability to manage remote sensors for multiple checkpoints simultaneously, implying infinite task capacity per vehicle. Conversely, the tasks impose strict demand constraints: Task 0, a critical high-voltage transformer, necessitates the synchronized attention of 2 vehicles ($Req=2$), whereas Task 1 and Task 2 are standard checkpoints requiring 1 vehicle each ($Req=1$). The objective is to determine an assignment strategy that satisfies the specific vehicle count requirements for every checkpoint while minimizing the total Euclidean distance of all established links between vehicles and equipment, treating each assignment as an independent distance minimization problem.
