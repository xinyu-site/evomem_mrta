The problem is defined within a city sector represented by XY spatial coordinates. We have a fleet of 3 aerial monitoring units, labeled as "Robots," and 3 environmental targets, labeled as "Tasks." Both entities adhere to a zero-based indexing convention. The goal is to solve a static resource dispatch problem at time step 0. The constraints are asymmetric: on the demand side, Task 0 explicitly requires 2 units, while Tasks 1 and 2 require 1 unit each. On the supply side, the Robots are "Multi-Tasking" agents, capable of servicing any number of targets concurrently without restriction. Consequently, the allocation for each Task becomes an independent optimization problem of finding the nearest available neighbors. The optimization goal is to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for all assigned pairings, ensuring that every Task receives its exact required number of Robots, even if it means a single Robot is assigned to multiple Tasks.
