In an urban atmospheric monitoring scenario mapped onto a 2D Cartesian plane, the operation utilizes 3 advanced air quality drones (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) to monitor 3 distinct pollution sensing zones (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The assignment logic is executed instantaneously at time step 0. A defining characteristic of this system is the infinite task capacity of the drones: a single drone possesses the computational power to process data from multiple zones simultaneously, meaning there is no upper limit to the number of tasks a single drone can accept. Conversely, the tasks have specific physical requirements: Task 0 is a large-scale zone requiring the simultaneous coverage of 2 drones, whereas Task 1 and Task 2 are standard zones requiring 1 drone each. The objective is to determine an assignment strategy that satisfies the specific drone count requirements for every task while minimizing the total Euclidean distance of all established links between drones and zones.
