The problem is defined within an urban traffic sector represented by XY spatial coordinates. We have 3 autonomous monitoring agents, labeled as "Robots," and 3 target road junctions, labeled as "Tasks." Both entities adhere to a zero-based indexing convention. The goal is to solve a static dispatch problem at time step 0. The constraints are defined by demand rather than supply: Task 0 explicitly requires 2 agents, while Tasks 1 and 2 require 1 agent each. On the supply side, the Robots function as "Multi-Task" entities, capable of servicing any number of targets concurrently. Consequently, the resource contention is eliminated, and the allocation for each Task becomes an independent optimization problem of finding the nearest available neighbors. The optimization goal is to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for all assigned pairings, ensuring that every Task receives its exact required number of agents.
