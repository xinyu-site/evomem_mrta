In a smart city traffic network mapped onto a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, the system manages a fleet of 3 mobile surveillance units (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) to monitor 3 critical intersections (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The resource allocation is computed instantaneously at time step 0. A key capability of this system is the multi-target tracking feature of the units: a single surveillance unit can be assigned to multiple intersections simultaneously without operational restrictions. Conversely, the intersections have distinct coverage requirements: Task 0 is a complex hub requiring the simultaneous attention of 2 units, while Task 1 and Task 2 require 1 unit each. The objective is to determine an assignment strategy that satisfies the specific unit count requirements for every intersection while minimizing the total Euclidean distance of all established links between units and intersections.
