In a two-dimensional environment, there are three robots and three tasks. Each task may require multiple robots, and each robot can handle multiple tasks. The task assignments happen instantaneously, with no need for future planning. Task 0 requires 2 robots, while Task 1 and Task 2 each require 1 robot. The objective is to allocate robots to tasks in a way that minimizes the total Euclidean distance. Each task must be assigned the exact number of robots as specified in the task's requirements. Robots can be assigned to multiple tasks at the same time, with no limit on how many tasks a robot can perform simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance for all robots assigned to their respective tasks.
