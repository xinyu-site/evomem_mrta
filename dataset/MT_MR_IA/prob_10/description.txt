In an urban environment mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, the operation involves 3 air quality monitoring drones and 3 pollution sensing zones. The drones are designated as Robots and the sensing zones as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The assignment is executed instantaneously at time step 0. Task 0 represents a large-scale pollution zone that requires 2 drones to monitor it effectively, while Task 1 and Task 2 are smaller zones requiring only 1 drone each. A unique feature of this system is that a single drone has the computational capacity to process data from multiple zones simultaneously; therefore, there is no restriction on the number of tasks a single drone can be assigned to at the same time. The goal is to allocate the drones to the zones to satisfy the specific drone count requirements for each task. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances between the assigned drones and their target sensing zones.
