Within a smart city traffic network represented by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 mobile surveillance units and 3 critical intersections. These entities are referred to as Robots and Tasks, respectively. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). Assignments are made instantaneously at time step 0. Task 0 is a major complex intersection that necessitates the simultaneous attention of 2 surveillance units, whereas Task 1 and Task 2 require 1 surveillance unit each. The surveillance units are equipped with advanced multi-target tracking systems, allowing a single unit to be assigned to multiple intersections simultaneously without restriction. The goal is to assign the units to the intersections to meet the specific unit count requirements. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance associated with these assignments.
