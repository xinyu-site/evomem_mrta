In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, 3 robots and 3 tasks are defined. The robots are at positions [0.0, 4.0], [1.0, 3.0], and [2.0, 1.0], and the tasks are positioned at [0.0, 3.0], [2.0, 0.0], and [2.0, 0.0]. Task 0 requires 2 robots to complete, while Task 1 and Task 2 each require only 1 robot.

The task assignments must minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots. Each task must be assigned to the required number of robots as per the TaskRequirements. The robots can simultaneously handle multiple tasks, and the optimal robot-task assignment is [[0, 1], [2], [2]], yielding a minimized total travel distance of 3.0.
