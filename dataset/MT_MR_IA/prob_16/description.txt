In the context of an electrical substation inspection mapped on a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate plane, the system manages 3 inspection vehicles and 3 equipment checkpoints. The vehicles are labeled as Robots and the checkpoints as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The task allocation occurs instantaneously at time step 0. Task 0 is a critical high-voltage transformer requiring 2 inspection vehicles for a synchronized check, while Task 1 and Task 2 are standard checkpoints requiring 1 vehicle each. Each inspection vehicle is capable of managing remote sensors for multiple checkpoints at once, meaning there is no limit to the number of tasks a single vehicle can handle simultaneously. The operational goal is to assign vehicles to checkpoints to fulfill the required vehicle counts. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances for all vehicle-to-checkpoint assignments.
