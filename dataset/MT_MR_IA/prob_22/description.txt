During a large-scale public event mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate grid, there are 3 security bots and 3 crowd sectors. These are categorized as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The deployment is calculated instantaneously at time step 0. Task 0 represents a high-density VIP area that requires 2 security bots for safety, while Task 1 and Task 2 are standard sectors requiring 1 security bot each. The security bots possess high-bandwidth communication links, enabling a single bot to oversee multiple sectors simultaneously if needed. The logistical goal is to assign bots to sectors to meet the mandatory bot count for each area. The objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances between the security bots and their assigned crowd sectors.
