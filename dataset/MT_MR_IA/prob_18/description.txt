The problem is defined within the spatial coordinates of a power grid substation. We have 3 autonomous ground units, labeled as "Robots," and 3 critical apparatus nodes, labeled as "Tasks." Both entities adhere to a zero-based indexing convention. The goal is to solve a static dispatch problem at time step 0. The constraints are defined strictly by demand: Task 0 requires a coalition of 2 units, while Tasks 1 and 2 require 1 unit each. On the supply side, the Robots function as "Multi-Task" entities, capable of servicing any number of nodes concurrently without mutual exclusion. Consequently, resource contention is eliminated, and the allocation for each Task simplifies to finding the nearest available neighbors regardless of their other commitments. The optimization goal is to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance for all assigned pairings, ensuring that every apparatus node receives its exact required number of inspection units.
