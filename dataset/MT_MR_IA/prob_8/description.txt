In a two-dimensional environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 3 tasks. The robots are positioned at [0.0, 4.0], [1.0, 3.0], and [2.0, 1.0], and the tasks are located at [0.0, 3.0], [2.0, 0.0], and [2.0, 0.0]. Each task requires the specified number of robots: Task 0 requires 2 robots, while Tasks 1 and 2 each require 1 robot.

The goal is to assign robots to tasks such that the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots is minimized. The tasks must be assigned within the task requirements, and robots can be assigned to multiple tasks. The optimal assignment to minimize the total Euclidean distance is [[0, 1], [2], [2]], with a minimal total distance of 3.0.
