In a protected forest reserve modeled on a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, the ecological management system controls a fleet of 3 monitoring rovers (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) to service 3 biological sampling sites (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-2). The resource allocation is computed instantaneously at time step 0. A defining capability of the rovers is their multi-tasking aptitude, allowing a single rover to be assigned to multiple sampling sites simultaneously without capacity restrictions. Conversely, the sampling sites impose specific coverage demands based on their ecological density: Task 0 is a biodiversity hotspot requiring the simultaneous presence of 2 rovers, whereas Task 1 and Task 2 are standard sites requiring 1 rover each. The objective is to determine an assignment strategy that satisfies the specific rover count requirements for every site while minimizing the total Euclidean distance of all established links between rovers and sites. Because rovers have unlimited capacity, the allocation for each site can be optimized independently.
