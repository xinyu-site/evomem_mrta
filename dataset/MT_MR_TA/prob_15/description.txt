This task allocation problem focuses on an intelligent transportation system where 3 autonomous mobile sensors are deployed to monitor 3 key traffic junctions within a 2D coordinate system. Both the sensors and the junctions are referenced using 0-based indexing. The surveillance mission spans a horizon of 4 time steps. Unlike simple coverage tasks, specific junctions in this network are designated as multi-robot tasks, requiring the convergence of a specified number of sensors at the exact same time step to capture data effectively. Furthermore, every monitoring task is constrained by a time window $[EarliestStep, LatestStep]$. The objective is to determine an optimal schedule that minimizes the cumulative Euclidean distance covered by the sensors, subject to the constraint that every junction receives its required simultaneous workforce within its valid execution window.
