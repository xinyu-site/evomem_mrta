During a large-scale public event mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate grid, there are 3 security bots and 3 critical crowd sectors. These are categorized as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The security operation is planned over 4 time steps, starting from time step 0. Each security bot can secure only one crowd sector at any given time step. However, larger or more dense crowd sectors require the simultaneous deployment of multiple security bots (MR) to be effectively managed. Each sector must be secured within a single time step, which must occur within the sector's defined time window. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the security bots while fulfilling the requirement that specific sectors be attended to by multiple bots simultaneously.
