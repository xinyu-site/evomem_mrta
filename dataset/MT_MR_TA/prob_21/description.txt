In this scenario, a fleet of 3 autonomous ground rovers is deployed to survey 3 key ecological targets distributed across a forest environment. The operational area is defined by a standard XY coordinate system, with both rovers and targets assigned an index starting from 0. The mission is planned over 4 time steps. Unlike independent sampling tasks, this scenario involves collaborative sensing: certain targets require the convergence of multiple rovers at the exact same time step to ensure comprehensive data gathering. Additionally, every target is subject to a specific validity interval $[EarliestStep, LatestStep]$. The goal is to generate an optimal schedule that minimizes the cumulative Euclidean distance covered by the rovers, ensuring that the specific multi-rover requirements are met for every target during its valid time window.
