We consider a security coordination problem for a major public event, modeled on a 2D Cartesian coordinate plane. The system comprises 3 autonomous security bots (Robots) and 3 critical crowd sectors (Tasks), all referenced using 0-based indexing (e.g., Robot 0, Task 0). The operation is scheduled over a timeline of 4 discrete time steps (indexed 0 to 3). A critical constraint in this scenario is synchronous coverage: due to high crowd density, specific sectors are designated as multi-robot tasks, requiring the simultaneous deployment of a specified number of bots to ensure effective management. Each task must be fully executed within a single time step that falls within a strict validity window defined by an EarliestStep and LatestStep. The optimization objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the security fleet while strictly satisfying the simultaneous workforce requirements for every crowd sector during its allowed timeframe.
