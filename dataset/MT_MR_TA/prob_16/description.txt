In the context of an electrical substation inspection mapped on a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate plane, there are 3 inspection vehicles and 3 high-voltage equipment clusters. The vehicles are labeled as Robots and the equipment clusters as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The inspection schedule allows for 4 time steps, starting from index 0. Each inspection vehicle can inspect only one equipment cluster at any given time step. However, for safety and triangulation purposes, some equipment clusters require a cooperative inspection by multiple vehicles simultaneously (MR). Each inspection task must be completed within a single time step, falling within the cluster's specific time window of valid start times. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the inspection vehicles, ensuring that the specific number of vehicles required for each cluster is present at the same time step.
