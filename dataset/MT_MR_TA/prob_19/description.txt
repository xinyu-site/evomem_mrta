Operating within a forest reserve defined by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 ecological monitoring rovers and 3 biological observation points. These are formally identified as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The monitoring period lasts for 4 time steps, indexed from 0 to 3. A rover can process only one observation point at a time step. To gather comprehensive data, specific observation points require the simultaneous effort of multiple rovers (MR). The sampling at any given point must be performed within a single time step, respecting the point's EarliestStep and LatestStep constraints. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the rovers, provided that the multi-rover requirement for each observation point is met during its assigned time step.
