In a 2D environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 6 tasks. The tasks must be assigned to robots over 5 discrete time steps. Each robot can execute multiple tasks simultaneously (MT), but each robot can only handle one task at a time. Some tasks require multiple robots simultaneously (MR), meaning each task must be performed by exactly the number of robots specified in the TaskRequirements. Tasks must be assigned within their respective time windows, which are defined by the EarliestStep and LatestStep for each task.
Key Constraints: 1. Each task must be assigned to the required number of robots within its valid time window (EarliestStep, LatestStep). 2. Each robot can handle only one task at any given time step. 
The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by robots while completing their assigned tasks. Tasks must be completed within a single time step, respecting their earliest and latest allowed start times. The objective is to find the robot-task assignment that minimizes the total travel distance. Before returning the total_distance, rounding can be applied to eliminate floating-point errors.
