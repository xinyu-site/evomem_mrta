We consider a Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem situated in an urban air quality monitoring context, modeled on a 2D Cartesian plane. The system comprises 3 autonomous drones and 3 pollution sensing zones, where all agents and tasks are identified using 0-based indexing. The mission timeline is discretized into 4 time steps (0 to 3). A critical constraint in this scenario is that certain pollution zones are defined as multi-robot tasks, necessitating the simultaneous presence of a specific number of drones to ensure valid data collection. Each task is further constrained by a time window [EarliestStep, LatestStep] and must be fully executed within a single time step. The objective is to generate an assignment schedule that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the drones while strictly satisfying the simultaneous capacity requirements and time window constraints for every sensing zone.
