In this crowd management scenario, a fleet of 3 mobile security units is deployed to monitor 3 high-priority zones within a large-scale event venue. The environment is represented as a two-dimensional XY grid, with both units and zones assigned an index starting from 0. The surveillance mission spans a finite horizon of 4 time steps. Unlike standard patrol tasks, this operation mandates cooperative security: certain zones require the convergence of multiple units at the exact same time step to maintain order effectively. Furthermore, every zone monitoring task is constrained by a specific time window for execution. The goal is to determine an assignment schedule that minimizes the cumulative Euclidean distance covered by the units, ensuring that the required number of agents simultaneously attend to each zone within its valid time window.
