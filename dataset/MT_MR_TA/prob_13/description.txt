Within a smart city traffic network represented by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 mobile surveillance units and 3 complex intersections. These are referred to as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The surveillance mission covers 4 time steps, where the time step index starts from 0. Each surveillance unit can monitor at most one intersection at a specific time step. Due to the complexity of the traffic flow, specific intersections require the simultaneous presence of multiple surveillance units (MR) to capture all angles. Each intersection monitoring task must be executed within a single time step, strictly adhering to its assigned time window defined by the EarliestStep and LatestStep. The objective is to assign the units to intersections such that the total Euclidean distance traveled is minimized, while satisfying the simultaneous unit requirements for each task.
