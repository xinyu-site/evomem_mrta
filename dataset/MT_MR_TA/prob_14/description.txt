In a smart city traffic management scenario modeled on a 2D Cartesian plane, we coordinate 3 mobile surveillance units to observe 3 complex intersections. These entities are identified as Robots and Tasks, respectively, with all indices starting from 0. The operation is scheduled over a timeline of 4 discrete time steps (0 to 3). A defining characteristic of this mission is the requirement for synchronized cooperation; due to the complexity of the traffic patterns, certain intersections necessitate the simultaneous presence of multiple units to ensure comprehensive monitoring. Each task must be fully executed within a single time step that falls within a specific validity window defined by an EarliestStep and a LatestStep. The optimization goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the surveillance fleet while strictly ensuring that the required number of units are present simultaneously at each intersection during its allowed timeframe.
