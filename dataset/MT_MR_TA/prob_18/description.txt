In this scenario, we manage a fleet of 3 autonomous vehicles deployed to inspect 3 high-voltage zones in a substation, mapped onto a 2D XY plane. Both the vehicles and the target zones are identified by an index starting from 0. The operation spans a finite horizon of 4 time steps. Unlike standard single-agent inspections, this problem mandates synchronous cooperation: specific zones are designated as multi-robot tasks, requiring the convergence of multiple vehicles at the exact same time step to perform the inspection. Furthermore, each task is constrained by a specific time window for execution. The optimization goal is to minimize the cumulative Euclidean distance traversed by the vehicles, subject to the strict constraint that the required number of agents must simultaneously service each zone within its valid time window.
