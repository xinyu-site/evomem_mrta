In a two-dimensional environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 3 tasks. These tasks must be allocated to robots across 4 distinct time steps. While robots can perform multiple tasks simultaneously (MT), each robot is limited to handling only one task per time step. Some tasks require multiple robots at the same time (MR), so each task must be assigned exactly the number of robots specified in the TaskRequirements. Tasks need to be assigned within their respective valid time windows, defined by the EarliestStep and LatestStep for each task.

Key Constraints: 
1. Each task must be allocated to the required number of robots within its valid time window, which is determined by the EarliestStep and LatestStep. 
2. Each robot can only handle one task at any given time step.

The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by robots while completing their assigned tasks. Each task must be completed within a single time step, while adhering to its earliest and latest possible start times. The goal is to determine the robot-task assignments that result in the minimum total travel distance. To ensure accuracy, rounding may be applied to eliminate any floating-point errors before returning the total distance.
