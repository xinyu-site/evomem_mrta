We address a cooperative Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem within a high-voltage electrical substation environment, represented as a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. The system involves 3 ground inspection vehicles (Robots) and 3 critical equipment clusters (Tasks), all referenced using 0-based indexing (e.g., Robot 0, Task 0). The inspection mission is planned over 4 discrete time steps (indexed 0 to 3). A key operational constraint is that certain equipment clusters require simultaneous inspection by a specific number of vehicles to satisfy safety or triangulation protocols. Each task must be fully executed within a single time step that falls within its designated valid time window. The objective is to compute an assignment that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the fleet while guaranteeing that every equipment cluster receives the required number of simultaneous vehicles during its allowable timeframe.
