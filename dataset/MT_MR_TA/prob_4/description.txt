In a 2D environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 3 tasks. The positions of the robots are as follows: Robot 0 at [0.0, 4.0], Robot 1 at [1.0, 3.0], and Robot 2 at [2.0, 0.0]. The positions of the tasks are: Task 0 at [0.0, 3.0], Task 1 at [2.0, 1.0], and Task 2 at [2.0, 2.0]. These tasks must be allocated to the robots across 3 time steps. 

Each robot can perform multiple tasks simultaneously (MT), but only one task can be handled at a time per robot. Some tasks require multiple robots (MR), and in this case, Task 0 requires 2 robots, while Tasks 1 and 2 each require 1 robot. The tasks must be assigned within their respective time windows, with EarliestStep and LatestStep defining the valid time range for each task. Specifically, Task 0 can be performed between time steps 0 and 1, Task 1 can be performed between time steps 0 and 2, and Task 2 can be performed between time steps 1 and 2.

Key Constraints: 
1. Each task must be assigned the required number of robots within its valid time window, as indicated by the EarliestStep and LatestStep for each task.
2. Each robot can handle only one task at any given time step.

The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots while completing their assigned tasks. Each task must be completed in a single time step, respecting its earliest and latest allowed start times. The goal is to determine the robot-task assignments that minimize the total travel distance. In this example, the total minimized travel distance is 4.0, which is the output.
