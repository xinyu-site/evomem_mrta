We investigate a multi-robot coordination problem within a protected forest reserve, modeled on a 2D Cartesian plane. The system consists of 3 ecological monitoring rovers (Robots) and 3 biological observation points (Tasks), all referenced using 0-based indexing (e.g., Robot 0, Task 0). The survey mission is constrained to a horizon of 4 discrete time steps (0 to 3). A key requirement of this operation is the synchronous data collection capability: specific observation points are classified as multi-robot tasks, necessitating the simultaneous arrival of a required number of rovers to capture valid biological data. Furthermore, each task must be executed within a strict time window defined by an EarliestStep and LatestStep. The optimization objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the rover fleet while strictly satisfying the simultaneous presence constraints for each observation point within its allowed schedule.
