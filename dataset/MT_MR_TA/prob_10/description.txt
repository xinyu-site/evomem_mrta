In an urban environment mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 air quality monitoring drones and 3 pollution sensing zones. These entities are designated as Robots and Tasks, respectively. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1, Task 2). The monitoring operation spans 4 discrete time steps, indexed from 0 to 3. The fleet handles multiple tasks across the schedule and each drone can handle multipile sensing zone at any given time step. However, certain large pollution zones require multiple drones to scan them simultaneously (MR) to ensure accurate data collection; therefore, each sensing zone task specifies a required number of drones. Each task must be completed within a single time step that falls within its specific valid time window (defined by EarliestStep and LatestStep). The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the drones while ensuring that every sensing zone receives its required number of simultaneous drones within its allowed timeframe.
