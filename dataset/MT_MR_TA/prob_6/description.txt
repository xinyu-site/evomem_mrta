In a two-dimensional environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, 3 robots and 3 tasks are placed at specific locations. The robots' positions are [0.0, 4.0], [1.0, 3.0], and [2.0, 0.0], while the tasks are located at [0.0, 3.0], [2.0, 1.0], and [2.0, 2.0]. The tasks need to be assigned to the robots over 4 discrete time steps. Each robot can perform multiple tasks simultaneously (MT), but only one task at a time. Some tasks, such as Task 0, require two robots (MR), while Tasks 1 and 2 each require only one robot.

Key Constraints: 1. Each task must be assigned to the required number of robots within its valid time window (EarliestStep, LatestStep). 2. Each robot can handle only one task at any given time step. 

The tasks must be assigned within their respective time windows, with Task 0 valid from time steps 0 to 1, Task 1 from time steps 0 to 2, and Task 2 from time steps 1 to 2. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots while completing their tasks. The minimal total distance for this assignment is 4.0.
