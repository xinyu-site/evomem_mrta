In a large-scale public event environment mapped onto a 2D Cartesian grid, the security command center manages 3 autonomous security bots (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) to secure 2 critical crowd zones (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-1). The operation is executed over a timeline of multiple discrete time steps starting from index 0. Unlike routine patrols, these high-density zones impose a "Simultaneous Coalition Requirement," necessitating the concurrent presence of a specific number of bots to effectively manage the crowd. This synchronized security action must be performed at a single time step within the zone's strictly defined validity window (EarliestStep to LatestStep). While each bot is capable of securing only one zone per time step, the system must coordinate the fleet to assemble the required teams at the precise moments. The objective is to return the optimization value that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the bots, ensuring that the specific multi-bot requirements for each zone are met within their valid time constraints.
