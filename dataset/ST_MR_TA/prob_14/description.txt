In a smart city traffic network modeled on a 2D Cartesian grid, the surveillance system controls 3 mobile monitoring units (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) to analyze 2 complex intersections (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-1). The operation proceeds over a sequence of time steps starting from index 0. Unlike standard intersections, these targets have complex geometries requiring the simultaneous deployment of multiple units to capture traffic data from all angles effectively. Specifically, each intersection $j$ dictates a "Simultaneous Robot Requirement" ($Req_j$), necessitating a precise number of units to be present at the same time step. This collaborative monitoring event must occur within a strict validity window defined by an EarliestStep and a LatestStep. While each unit can only monitor one intersection per time step, the system must coordinate the fleet to form the required coalitions at the right moments. The objective is to return the optimization value that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the units while satisfying the simultaneous coverage mandates within the assigned time limits.
