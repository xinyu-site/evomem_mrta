In the context of a high-voltage substation mapped onto a 2D Cartesian plane, the maintenance system manages 3 inspection vehicles (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) and 2 complex equipment clusters (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-1). The operation is scheduled over multiple discrete time steps starting from index 0. Unlike standard checks, these high-voltage clusters impose a "Simultaneous Presence Requirement," necessitating a specific number of vehicles to inspect the equipment cooperatively to ensure safety and data accuracy. This joint inspection must occur at a single time step within a strictly defined validity window (EarliestStep to LatestStep). While each vehicle operates under the constraint of handling only one task per time step, the system must synchronize their arrival to form the necessary inspection coalitions. The objective is to return the value that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the fleet while satisfying the simultaneous vehicle requirements for each cluster within the valid timeframes.
