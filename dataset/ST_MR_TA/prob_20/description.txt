In a protected forest reserve mapped onto a 2D Cartesian grid, the ecological command center operates 3 autonomous monitoring rovers (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) to study 2 extensive sampling sites (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-1). The monitoring schedule is organized over multiple time steps starting from index 0. Unlike standard observation points, these large sites require a "Simultaneous Swarm Action," meaning a specific number of rovers must coordinate to sample the site at the exact same moment to generate valid data. This synchronized event must take place at a single time step within the site's strictly defined validity window (EarliestStep to LatestStep). While each rover is limited to visiting one site per time step, the system must orchestrate their movements to form the required coalitions. The goal is to return the value that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traversed by the fleet, ensuring that the necessary group of rovers is assembled for each site within the allowable timeframes.
