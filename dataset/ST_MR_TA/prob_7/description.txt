In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 2 tasks. The robots' positions are [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0], and [4.0, 1.0]. The tasks are located at [1.0, 2.0] and [5.0, 1.0]. Each task must be completed within a time window, and Task 0 requires 2 robots while Task 1 requires only 1.
For correct modeling, you only need to consider the following two constraints: 1. Each Task must be assigned to the required number of Robots within its time window. 2. Each Robot can handle only one Task at any given time step.
The tasks must be assigned within the time windows defined by EarliestStep and LatestStep. Task 0 can be assigned between time steps 0 and 1, and Task 1 between time steps 1 and 2. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots while completing their assigned tasks. The total minimal distance for this configuration is 3.0.
