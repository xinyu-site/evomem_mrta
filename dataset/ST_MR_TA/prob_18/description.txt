The problem is defined within the spatial coordinates of an electrical substation environment. The system coordinates 3 autonomous ground units, labeled as "Robots" (indices 0, 1, 2), to service 2 critical infrastructure nodes, labeled as "Tasks" (indices 0, 1). The mission planning horizon begins at time step 0. Each infrastructure node dictates a specific "Coalition Constraint," requiring the concurrent deployment of a fixed group size of Robots to perform the task effectively. This service must be rendered instantaneously at a single time step $t$ that falls strictly within the node's allowable time window. Physical constraints dictate that a single Robot can attend to at most one Task at any given time step. The optimization goal is to determine the minimum aggregate Euclidean distance required for the deployment, ensuring that the mandated number of vehicles are assembled for each node at the correct operational moment.
