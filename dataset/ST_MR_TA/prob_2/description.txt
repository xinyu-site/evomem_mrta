In a 2D environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are three Robots and two Tasks. Each Robot can only handle one Task at a time (Single-Task Robot, ST), but some Tasks may require multiple Robots simultaneously (Multi-Robot Task, MR). Task assignments span multiple time steps (TA) within the task's valid time window. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the Robots while completing their Tasks.
For correct modeling, you only need to consider the following two constraints: 1. Each Task must be assigned to the required number of Robots within its time window. 2. Each Robot can handle only one Task at any given time step.
Tasks must be completed within a single time step, respecting their earliest and latest allowed start times. The code only needs to return the value that minimizes the total Euclidean distance that the robot has traveled to complete the task.
