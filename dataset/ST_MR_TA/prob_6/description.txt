In a 2D XY Cartesian coordinate system, 3 robots and 2 tasks are situated. The robots' positions are [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0], and [4.0, 1.0]. The tasks are located at [1.0, 2.0] and [5.0, 1.0]. Tasks must be assigned within their respective time windows, with Task 0 needing 2 robots and Task 1 requiring only 1 robot. 
For correct modeling, you only need to consider the following two constraints: 1. Each Task must be assigned to the required number of Robots within its time window. 2. Each Robot can handle only one Task at any given time step.
The task assignments span 3 time steps. Task 0 can be completed between time steps 0 and 1, and Task 1 must be completed between time steps 1 and 2. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots. The minimal total travel distance in this example is 3.0.
