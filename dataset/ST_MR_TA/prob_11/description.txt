In an urban atmospheric monitoring scenario mapped onto a 2D Cartesian plane, the operation involves 3 specialized air quality drones (designated as Robots, indexed 0-2) and 2 heavy-pollution zones requiring analysis (designated as Tasks, indexed 0-1). The mission is coordinated over a timeline starting from index 0. Unlike standard monitoring, these heavy-pollution zones are complex and may require a coalition of drones to scan them simultaneously to be effective. Specifically, each sensing zone $j$ has a requirement for a specific number of drones $Req_j$ to be present at the same instant. The monitoring event for each zone must occur at a single time step within its strictly defined validity window (EarliestStep to LatestStep). While a drone can only engage in one task per time step, the system must synchronize the arrival of the required number of drones to form a temporary coalition. The objective is to calculate the minimum total Euclidean distance traveled by the fleet to satisfy these simultaneous coverage requirements within the valid time constraints.
