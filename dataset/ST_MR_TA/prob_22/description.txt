During a large-scale public event mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate grid, there are 3 security bots and 2 critical crowd zones. These are categorized as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1). The security operation takes place over multiple time steps, starting from index 0. Each security bot can secure only one crowd zone at a time (ST), but larger crowd zones may require the simultaneous presence of multiple security bots (MR) to be effectively managed. Each zone must be secured within a single time step, which must occur within the zone's defined time window. The objective is to return the value that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the security bots while fulfilling the requirement that specific zones be attended to by multiple bots simultaneously.
