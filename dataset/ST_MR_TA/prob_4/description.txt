In a 2D environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 Robots and 2 Tasks. The positions of the Robots are as follows: Robot 0 at [1.0, 1.0], Robot 1 at [2.0, 2.0], and Robot 2 at [4.0, 1.0]. The positions of the Tasks are: Task 0 at [1.0, 2.0] and Task 1 at [5.0, 1.0]. The EarliestStep and LatestStep for each task are: Task 0 has an EarliestStep of 0 and a LatestStep of 1, while Task 1 has an EarliestStep of 1 and a LatestStep of 2. Task 0 requires 2 robots, and Task 1 requires 1 robot. There are 3 robots and 2 tasks, and the task assignments span 3 time steps.

The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the Robots while completing their Tasks. For correct modeling, the following two constraints are considered: 1. Each Task must be assigned to the required number of Robots within its time window. 2. Each Robot can handle only one Task at any given time step.

Tasks must be completed within a single time step, respecting their earliest and latest allowed start times. The code only needs to return the value that minimizes the total Euclidean distance that the robots have traveled to complete the tasks. For this specific example, the minimal total distance traveled by the robots is 3.0.
