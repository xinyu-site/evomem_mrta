The scenario is set within the spatial confines of a major event venue, defined by XY coordinates. The system coordinates 3 mobile security units, labeled as "Robots" (indices 0, 1, 2), to monitor 2 high-risk sectors, labeled as "Tasks" (indices 0, 1). The mission planning spans a series of time steps beginning at $t=0$. Each high-risk sector dictates a "Group Size Constraint," meaning it requires the simultaneous deployment of multiple units to establish a secure perimeter. This deployment must occur instantaneously at a time step $t$ that falls strictly within the sector's assigned time window. Physical constraints ensure that a single unit can attend to at most one sector at any given time. The goal is to determine the minimum aggregate Euclidean distance for all deployed units, optimizing the spatiotemporal allocation to satisfy the collaborative security needs of each sector.
