In a 2D environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 2 tasks. The robots are located at positions [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0], and [4.0, 1.0], and the tasks are positioned at [1.0, 2.0] and [5.0, 1.0]. Task 0 requires 2 robots to complete, and Task 1 requires only 1 robot. 
For correct modeling, you only need to consider the following two constraints: 1. Each Task must be assigned to the required number of Robots within its time window. 2. Each Robot can handle only one Task at any given time step.
Each task must be assigned to the required number of robots within its respective time window. Task 0 can be assigned during time steps 0 to 1, while Task 1 can be assigned between time steps 1 and 2. The goal is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots. The minimum total travel distance for this configuration is 3.0.
