In an urban environment mapped onto a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 air quality monitoring drones and 2 heavy-pollution sensing zones. These entities are designated as Robots and Tasks, respectively. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1). The operation spans multiple time steps, starting from time index 0. While each drone can handle only one sensing zone at a time (ST), some sensing zones are large or complex and require multiple drones to scan them simultaneously (MR) to be effective. Each sensing zone must be monitored within its valid time window, defined by an earliest and latest allowed start time. The monitoring action is instantaneous and must be completed within a single time step by the required group of drones. The objective is to return the value that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the drones while satisfying the simultaneous robot requirements for each task.
