The operation takes place within a forest ecology zone defined by XY spatial coordinates. The system manages 3 mobile sensor units, labeled as "Robots" (indices 0, 1, 2), to process 2 complex biological targets, labeled as "Tasks" (indices 0, 1). The mission timeline spans a series of discrete time steps beginning at $t=0$. Each biological target imposes a "Coalition Requirement," necessitating the concurrent deployment of a specific number of units to perform the sampling effectively. This action is instantaneous and must be executed at a time step $t$ that falls strictly within the target's assigned time window. Constraints specify that a single unit can attend to at most one target at any given time. The optimization objective is to minimize the aggregate Euclidean distance of all deployed units, optimizing the spatiotemporal organization of the fleet to meet the collaborative sampling needs.
