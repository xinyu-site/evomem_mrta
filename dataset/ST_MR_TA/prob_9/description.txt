In a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, 3 robots and 2 tasks are situated. The robots are positioned at [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0], and [4.0, 1.0], and the tasks are located at [1.0, 2.0] and [5.0, 1.0]. The tasks must be assigned to robots within the defined time windows. Task 0 requires 2 robots, and Task 1 requires 1 robot.
For correct modeling, you only need to consider the following two constraints: 1. Each Task must be assigned to the required number of Robots within its time window. 2. Each Robot can handle only one Task at any given time step.
Each task must be assigned to the specified number of robots within the time window given by EarliestStep and LatestStep. Task 0 can be completed between time steps 0 and 1, while Task 1 must be completed between time steps 1 and 2. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots while completing their tasks. The minimal total distance in this scenario is 3.0.
