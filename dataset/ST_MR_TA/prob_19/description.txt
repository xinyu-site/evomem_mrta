Operating within a forest reserve defined by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 ecological monitoring rovers and 2 large sampling sites. These are formally identified as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1). The monitoring schedule spans multiple time steps, indexed from 0. Each rover can process only one sampling site at a time (ST). However, to gather comprehensive data, some sampling sites require the simultaneous effort of multiple rovers (MR). The sampling at any given site must be performed within a single time step, respecting the site's earliest and latest allowed start times. The goal is to return the value that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the rovers, provided that the multi-rover requirement for each sampling site is met during its assigned time step.
