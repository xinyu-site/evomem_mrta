The problem is defined within a two-dimensional XY coordinate system representing a city sector. The system manages 3 autonomous UAVs, labeled as "Robots" (indices 0, 1, 2), to service 2 critical pollution targets, labeled as "Tasks" (indices 0, 1). The scheduling horizon begins at time step 0. Each pollution target imposes a "Simultaneous Robot Requirement," meaning it necessitates the concurrent presence of multiple Robots to perform the sensing task effectively. This action is instantaneous and must be completed at a specific time step $t$ that falls within the target's allowable time window. Constraints dictate that a single Robot can attend to at most one Task at any given time. The goal is to determine the optimal resource allocation value that minimizes the aggregate Euclidean distance of all deployed drones, ensuring that the required group size is assembled for each target at the correct moment.
