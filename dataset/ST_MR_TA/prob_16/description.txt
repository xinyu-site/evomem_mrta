In the context of an electrical substation inspection mapped on a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate plane, there are 3 inspection vehicles and 2 high-voltage equipment clusters. The vehicles are labeled as Robots and the equipment clusters as Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1). Assignments span multiple time steps, starting from index 0. Each vehicle can inspect only one equipment cluster at a time (ST), but certain high-voltage clusters require a cooperative inspection by multiple vehicles simultaneously (MR) for safety and accuracy. Each inspection task must be completed within a single time step, falling within the cluster's specific time window of valid start times. The objective is to return the value that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the inspection vehicles, ensuring that the specific number of vehicles required for each cluster is present at the same time step.
