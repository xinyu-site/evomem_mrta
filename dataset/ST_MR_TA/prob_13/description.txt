Within a smart city traffic network represented by a two-dimensional XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 mobile surveillance units and 2 major complex intersections. These are referred to as Robots and Tasks. Both robots and tasks are indexed starting from 0 (e.g., Robot 0, Robot 1, Robot 2, Task 0, Task 1). The surveillance mission covers multiple time steps, where the time step index starts from 0. Each surveillance unit can monitor only one intersection at any given time step (ST). However, due to the complexity of the traffic patterns, some intersections require the simultaneous deployment of multiple surveillance units (MR) to capture data from all angles. Each intersection monitoring task must be executed within a single time step, strictly adhering to its assigned time window defined by earliest and latest start times. The goal is to return the value that minimizes the total Euclidean distance traveled by the surveillance units while ensuring each intersection gets the required number of simultaneous units.
