In a two-dimensional environment with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, there are 3 robots and 2 tasks. The robots are positioned at [1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0], and [4.0, 1.0], while the tasks are located at [1.0, 2.0] and [5.0, 1.0]. Task assignments are completed over 3 time steps, with each robot handling only one task at a time. Some tasks require multiple robots, meaning Task 0 requires 2 robots, while Task 1 only requires 1 robot. 
For correct modeling, you only need to consider the following two constraints: 1. Each Task must be assigned to the required number of Robots within its time window. 2. Each Robot can handle only one Task at any given time step.
Each task has a time window defined by EarliestStep and LatestStep. Task 0 must be completed between time steps 0 and 1, and Task 1 must be completed between time steps 1 and 2. The objective is to minimize the total Euclidean distance traveled by the robots while completing their tasks. The minimal total distance for this configuration is 3.0.
