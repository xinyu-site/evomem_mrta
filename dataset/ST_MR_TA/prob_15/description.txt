The scenario operates within an XY coordinate system representing an urban roadway network. There are 3 autonomous surveillance agents (Robots 0-2) available to service 2 major traffic hubs (Tasks 0-1). The mission planning spans multiple discrete time steps starting from $t=0$. Each traffic hub imposes a specific constraint known as a "Coalition Requirement," meaning it requires the concurrent service of a specific group size of agents to be considered complete. This service must be rendered instantaneously at a single time step $t$ that falls within the hub's designated time window. Physical limitations ensure that a single agent can attend to at most one hub at any given time. The optimization goal is to determine the minimum aggregate Euclidean distance required to position the agents, ensuring that the necessary coalitions are assembled for each hub within their valid operational windows.
